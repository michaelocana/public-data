        <title>Advanced Workflow</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/advanced_workflow</link>
        <description>What is it?When is it used? </description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used? How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?Advanced Workflow&amp;nbsp;allows you to pick from a variety of pre_defined user or system workflow activities and assimilate them in any order needed to build workflows for automating complex business processes so as to simplify and reduce the time spent on these processes.Using the&amp;nbsp;Advanced Workflow Process Designer, you can choose from among the pre_defined activities, and graphically arrange them into a logical workflow which mirrors your business process.There are four different types of pre_defined activities:Automated Document Management Activities&amp;nbsp;_ These activities include all the actions related to document handling that are normally done by the user to create, manage, and work with documents and folders in SpringCM. This includes but is not limited to creating documents from templates, creating folders,&amp;nbsp; applying security to documents and folders, copying &amp;amp; moving documents, emailing documents, locking documents, assigning document attributes, and searching for documents and folders.Human Activities&amp;nbsp;_ These are activities that will require some human intervention and which will appear as workflow tasks in the SpringCM users workflow inbox. This includes but is not limited to editing documents, approving documents, selecting documents for inclusion in the workflow or users to participate in the workflow, and providing input via an electronic form.Engine Activities &amp;nbsp;These are activities which allow you to construct the logical flow and decision tree of your workflow such as variable manipulation, loops, decision rules, and the ability to initiate additional workflows.Scheduling and Communication&amp;nbsp; These are activities which allow you to control the timing and the communication surrounding the workflow such as setting timers, reminders, alerts, and sending e_mail status updates or step_ownership notifications.When is it used?There are several built_in methods in SpringCM for automating business processes such as&amp;nbsp;Smart Rules,&amp;nbsp;Send for External Review,eForms, Send for Signature, and&amp;nbsp;Approval Workflows. These methods are targeted but flexible, and can provide some rather extensive capabilities. However, there may be times when you are trying to automate more complex business processes that cannot be met by one of these targeted features alone. For these business processes, the SpringCM&amp;nbsp;Advanced Workflow&amp;nbsp;provides a solution. It is flexible and powerful enough to allow you to map any business process regardless of the complexity. In many cases an&amp;nbsp;Advanced Workflow&amp;nbsp;may be used in tandem with another SpringCM feature (e.g., Smart Rules, eForms) to provide the complete workflow solution.For example, a common use of the SpringCM&amp;nbsp;Advanced Workflow&amp;nbsp;is the complex processes surrounding contract generation and approval. Contracts are often standard in format but by their nature are highly susceptible to human error.&amp;nbsp; Automating the contract generation from pre_defined data using Advanced Workflow can remove human error and reduce human effort. Once created, contracts need to be reviewed, updated, and approved by people with different access levels and authorities.&amp;nbsp; In this situation, advanced workflow can handle the distribution, the version control, and the approval process to ensure that the most current version of the contract is being reviewed and approved by all the right people. Finally, an approved contract needs too be archived for future reference. For this, advanced workflow can create folders and move documents to different folders based on document attributes and workflow status. Because of the flexibility and power of the SpringCM Advanced Workflow, this entire contract process can be managed with a single workflow allowing for governance of the contract from generation through to renewal.Advanced Workflow is available only to&amp;nbsp;Enterprise&amp;nbsp;customers.&amp;nbsp; If you do not have Advanced Workflow and want to add this option to you account, please visit the&amp;nbsp;Add Advanced Workflow&amp;nbsp;page.How is it used?Advanced Workflow provides the ability to build complex workflows, and by its nature it is intended to provide a platform for development of these complex workflows. Creation of a workflow using Advanced Workflow cannot be described in a series of steps, but rather requires a thorough understanding of the Advanced Workflow Process Designer, XML, xPath, process logic fundamentals, and many other supporting topics. With this in mind, it is not feasible to provide a simple set of steps for how to use Advanced Workflow.For persons interested in using Advanced Workflow, SpringCM also offers a 2_3 day training program that teaches participants how to use the SpringCM Advanced Workflow Process Designer to configure complex workflows. Taught in a workshop format, the course focuses on best practices, standard conventions, and the creation of advanced workflow processes based on real business cases.&amp;nbsp; The Advanced Workflow Process Designer will not be enabled in any Production account until a user in the account has attended training.Contact Client Services at&amp;nbsp;support@springcm.com&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;877.362.7273&amp;nbsp;if you are interested in Advanced Workflow training or Professional Services support for your advanced workflow design needs.</content:encoded>

        <title>Personas</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/personas</link>
        <description></description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?Personas, or role_based user settings, are used to create a unique display in the SpringCM interface for things like menu, toolbar and navigation options.&amp;nbsp;The &quot;Persona&quot; is based on a Security Group name, and an individual user is assigned a single &quot;Persona&quot; in their user record in the SpringCM Address Book.&amp;nbsp; Personas are created from Security Groups and are applied in users' profiles.When is it used?Based on the specific job a person has in SpringCM, use of Personas can help simplify a user's experience and actions taken while working in the platform.&amp;nbsp; Different buttons and menu items are displayed specific to the user's Persona or job function.For example, a training manager will see different buttons on the user interface than an HR manager will, making end_user training a matter of minutes and hours rather than days or weeks.How is it used?Steps to assign a SpringCM user to a specific &quot;Persona&quot;:Navigate to the Address Book tab.Create a Security Group with the name of the desired Persona.&amp;nbsp; For example, &quot;Accounts Payable Processor&quot;, or &quot;HR Resume Reviewer&quot;.Navigate to each user's record who should be assigned the Persona.&amp;nbsp; In the &quot;Persona&quot; field on their user record, type in the name of the Security Group created in step 2.&amp;nbsp; To note: A user can only be assigned one persona.&amp;nbsp;Assign the same user the corresponding Persona from the Persona dropdown menu.Steps to create a &quot;Persona&quot; view:&amp;nbsp;Navigate to Documents tab.Select View menu option.Choose &quot;Customize Navigation&quot;, &quot;Customize Toolbar&quot; or &quot;Customize Menu&quot;When any of the 3 options are selected, you will be given a choice to create a view and assign it to a &quot;Persona&quot;.&amp;nbsp;Make your selection and click &quot;Save&quot;.Any user who has been assigned the &quot;Persona&quot; will now see the changed display(s) when they login to SpringCM.</content:encoded>

        <description></description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?In the Documents section under the View menu dropdown, Super Administrators can &quot;Customize Menu&quot; and &quot;Customize Toolbar&quot; to determine which actions are visible for all users' Menu selections and Toolbar icon displays.&amp;nbsp; Custom Menu Items can be converted to Toolbar Buttons.When is it used?Clients use Customize Menu and Customize Toolbar to add specific actions (like Workflow events) or to remove certain Toolbar icon displays (like &quot;Create Folder&quot;).&amp;nbsp; When customizing these views, new actions can be ADDED to the menu dropdowns.&amp;nbsp; Those new actions can then be ADDED to the toolbar.&amp;nbsp;The addition or removal of actions from displays can help simplify a users' experience for the task they have to perform.&amp;nbsp; For example, an AP Processor might need to just have to take actions like &quot;Approve Invoice&quot;, &quot;Reject Invoice&quot;, or &quot;Escalate Invoice&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Based on workflows tied to these actions, &quot;Customize Menu&quot; could be used to build links to these workflows, and then &quot;Customize Toolbar&quot; used to add actual icons for each of these 3 actions.&amp;nbsp; The view can be tied to a group of users via a Persona assignment.How is it used?Customize MenuClick the Documents tab.Open the View menu and choose the Customize Menu feature.To add a new menu item, click the New Menu Item button, complete the Name, Description, and URL.If necessary, add a User Key, Selection, and Icon URLSelect the Menu item the New item will follow, and&amp;nbsp;if necessary, Personas to which the item will be available using the drop down menus.Click the Save button.To edit an existing menu item, select it from the example menu. Customize Toolbar1. Click the Customize Toolbar from the View menu2. In the window that appears, select the Menu Item to convert to a Toolbar Item. The menu item icon will appear on the toolbar at the right_most position.3. Using the window controls, move the Toolbar Icon to the desired positon on the toolbar, and add Separators if desired.4. If necessary, Select a Persona to which the Toolbar Icon will be available using the drop down menu.5. Click the Save button.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>250 Character Windows Path Limitations</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/250_character_windows_path_limitations</link>
        <description></description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?The 250 character limitation is a Windows limitation where the number of characters that can be used to define the path to where a document resides locally. This limit is 250 characters and begins from the hard drive that the document is stored on and ends with the document name. All folders are included in the path.&amp;nbsp; This may impacts document and folders when SpringCM Business Sync is used.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?It is used as part of the sync process to identify where documents are stored locally. The Windows Sync application calculates the number of characters that are used when creating a document locally and if the entire path exceeds 250 characters, it will trigger a conflict for the user to resolve.How is it used?For users that have just installed SpringCM Sync 1.6 or greater for Windows, the default My SpringCM Files Location has been set to:&amp;lt;&amp;gt;:\Users\&amp;lt;&amp;gt;\SpringCM. (ex C:\Users\tsmith\SpringCM).&amp;nbsp;The SpringCM Folder Location can be changed by selecting Move from the SpringCM Business Sync Account Preferences Page. When you select Move, you will need to select a Folder that does not have any other content.There are three scenarios for using Sync, and the way the 250 character limitation is processed in SpringCM is handled slightly differently.Scenario #1 : Users that have a single SpringCM account that has been enabled for SyncThe Account Name Folder will not be defined in the Path. Most customers meet this criteria and only have a single account. In the example below, the Account Name is not included in the Path.&amp;nbsp;Scenario #2: Users that have multiple SpringCM accounts that have been enabled for SyncThe Account Name Folder will be defined in the Path.&amp;nbsp;Scenario #3: Users that start with a single SpringCM account that has been enabled for Sync and then a second account is enabled for SyncThe application must update Folder Paths to include the Account Name. When the app identifies that this event has occurred, it will begin update local folder structures to account for this change.&amp;nbsp;If it identifies that documents are folders are open at the time this takes places, then it will warn the user and ask them to close all documents and folders.&amp;nbsp; If the user identifies that they want to try later, it will try again until Sync is restarted.&amp;nbsp; If the user completes this task and it finds that documents are still open, then it will warn the user.</content:encoded>

In cases where large files of a type generally not associated with a business document (e.g., large log files) are added to the system, full_text search and preview are not typically not required. With that in mind, the following limits have been put in place to ensure overall system performance:The following file types and sizes will not generate a document previewText files (*.txt) greater than 1MB in sizeAny file greater than 256MB in sizeAny file that creates a PDF greater than 256MB in sizeAn empty Excel (*.xls or *.xlsx) fileThe following file types and sizes will not be full_text searchableAny file larger than 256MB in sizeThe following file types and sizes will not be available for document comparisonAny valid file type (i.e., those which are supported with the document comparison feature) greater than 128MB in size</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>When is it used?How to setup secure mappingHow to edit/delete secure mappingWhat is it?Salesforce Security Mapping is a feature that allows for one_step synchronization&amp;nbsp;of Salesforce (Profiles and Roles) and SpringCM (Security Groups). This allows for administrators in Salesforce to setup mapping in SpringCM that automatically places Salesforce users by their Profile or Role into the correct SpringCM security groups.When is it used?Salesforce Security Mapping is used when administrators want to easily map their Salesforce users by Profile and Role into the correct SpringCM security groups. Setting up the secure mapping feature before adding users allows for easily intergration as you add in new users.How to setup secure mappingGo to Preferences &amp;gt; Account Preferences &amp;gt; Salesforce ConfigurationNote: This can be done by logging into SpringCM or navigating to the SpringCM Viewer in SalesforceScroll to Map Salesforce and SpringCM Security.Click Add New Mapping.Select the Salesforce Profiles/Roles.Select the desired security group under SpringCM Security Groups.Click the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; button to add the security group.Click Save&amp;nbsp;when done.How to edit/delete secure mappingGo to Preferences &amp;gt; Account Preferences &amp;gt; Salesforce ConfigurationNote: This can be done by logging into SpringCM or navigating to the SpringCM Viewer in SalesforceScroll to Map Salesforce and SpringCM Security.Select Edit or Delete next to desired Salesforce Profile/Role Name.Select the desired security group under SpringCM Security Groups.Click the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; button to add the security group.Click the &amp;lt;&amp;lt; to delete the security group.Click&amp;nbsp;Save&amp;nbsp;when done.Note: Security groups must be setup in SpringCM before securing mapping, otherwise an error will occur.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to setup WebDAVWhat is it?WebDAV is a method for transferring data via the Internet that bypasses most firewalls. It serves as a powerful alternative to FTP.When is it used?Use WebDAV to edit documents using Microsoft Office (MS Office) applications without physically checking out / in documents. You can configure Windows Explorer to provide drag_and_drop access to your SpringCM folders and to create a seamless integration with your documents in SpringCM.WebDAV creates a secure Web link to your SpringCM folders that gives you access to all your accounts. It uses a single network folder in My Network Places that you log into securely, much like the Web login but within the familiar Windows Explorer environment. WebDAV requires use of the following software:Windows 7, Vista, or XPInternet Explorer 7 or higherYou can perform the following actions while viewing your SpringCM content in Windows Explorer:Create new folders.List folders, subfolders, documents in foldersUpload and download documents.Move, copy, rename and delete folders and/or documents.WebDAV integration means that the SpringCM Toolbar for MS Office is no longer necessary, but a one_time configuration of your WebDAV Server Access to Folders in SpringCM is required.How to setup WebDAVWindows XP or VistaWindows XP or Vista has a basic WebDAV client pre_installed that manages the checking in and out of Microsoft documents. To use advanced functionality, you may want to install a separate client such as Web Drive.Select Start &amp;gt; My Network Places &amp;gt; Add Network Place.1. You will see a window requesting Service provider information. Select Choose another network location.2. In the Internet or network address field, type the following: https://webdav.springcm.com3. The WebDAV server is password_protected. You must enter your SpringCM username and password to access your folders.4. After you log in, you will see your SpringCM folder available in My Network Places. Opening this folder reveals the main folder for each of your accounts.Windows 71. Selct Computer &amp;gt; Map&amp;nbsp;a Network Drive.2. Select a&amp;nbsp;drive letter.3. Type&amp;nbsp;https://webdavna11.springcm.com/ into the folder field.4. Click Finish.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>User Bulk Load</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/user_bulk_load</link>
        <description>User Synchronization</description>
        <content:encoded>User SynchronizationSpringCM offers three integration methodologies for the synchronization of users and groups from an enterprise user repository to the SpringCM Address Book. The three methods are:Bulk loading via predefined CSV formatsSOAP based Web servicesSynchronization from SalesforceNote: The first 2 methods listed above do not involve directly connecting SpringCM to an internal LDAP or Active Directory instance. They first require the data to be queried from the repository and then pushed via web services or CSV. With the third option, SpringCM will directly connect to Salesforce for synchronization.All options are described in detail in this section.Bulk User Import CSV File and Document Rule&amp;nbsp;SpringCM provides a standard CSV format that can be used to create users, delete users, create groups, and update group memberships. The CSV &amp;nbsp;file may be uploaded directly in the Address Book user interface or triggered via a Bulk User Import Document Rule that is often used in conjunction with FTP/SFTP. The CSV file may be generated manually in an application like Microsoft Excel or it can be scripted against a source repository. Some scripting examples are shown later in this section.CSV FormatThe first row of the CSV file must contain the headers describing each column's data. The headers can be the following:Email:&amp;nbsp;The email address of the user. This is always required.FirstName:&amp;nbsp;First name of the userLastName:&amp;nbsp;Last name of the userRole:&amp;nbsp;The users role. If omitted for a new user, the user will be created with the role of &quot;Full Subscriber&quot;. If updating the user, they will maintain their current role.Groups:&amp;nbsp;This is a pipe(|) delimited list of the group names that the user on the line is a member of. The user will be removed from any groups they are currently a member of that are not in the list and will be added to any new groups in the list. If the group name does not exist in the account, the group will automatically be created and the user will then be added as a member.Active:&amp;nbsp;Valid values for this field is either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. A value of &quot;true&quot; means they belong in the Address Book, and false means that they will be deleted.Title:&amp;nbsp;The user's title that will show in the address book.Department:&amp;nbsp;The user's department that will show up in the address book.Company:&amp;nbsp;The user's company that will show up in the address book.Address1:&amp;nbsp;The user's address line 1 that will show up in the address book.Address2:&amp;nbsp;The user's address line 2 that will show up in the address book.Address3:&amp;nbsp;The user's address line 3 that will show up in the address book.City:&amp;nbsp;The user's city that will show up in the address book.State:&amp;nbsp;The user's state/province that will show up in the address book.PostalCode:&amp;nbsp;The user's postal code that will show up in the address book.Country:&amp;nbsp;The user's country that will show up in the address book. Should be a valid country name from the address book's country drop down list.PhoneNumber:&amp;nbsp;The user's phone number that will show up in the address book.FaxNumber:&amp;nbsp;The user's fax number that will show up in the address book.Persona:&amp;nbsp;The user's persona, should a valid name of a persona already created in the account.ManagedBy:&amp;nbsp;The user's manager, should be a valid email address of a user in the account. SendActivationEmail: Valid values for this field is either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Indicates if activation email will be sent to created user.EnabledStartDate:&amp;nbsp;The start date when this user can access the account.EnabledEndDate:&amp;nbsp;The end date when this user can access the account.Processing via Address Book UploadOnce a CSV file is created, it may be uploaded directly in the Address Book user interface. On the Address Book tab choose Address Book&amp;gt;Bulk Import Users. You will be taken to a new screen and prompted to upload your CSV. If any errors or warnings occur, SpringCM will email you with a detailed log of the data issues encountered while processing the CSV.Document Rule ConfigurationTo setup an account to process bulk user import formatted CSV files, first create a folder in SpringCM that will be used as the destination for uploading the inbound CSV files. Best practices dictate that this folder should only be accessible by Super Administrators and only used to upload bulk user import CSVs. Once the folder is created, navigate to Preferences, click on Smart Rules and then choose Rule_&amp;gt; New Document Rule from the drop down menu and configure a new rule with the following parameters.Event: Document AddedFilters: In Folder [your bulk user import folder] and Has Name Like [*.csv]Actions: &quot;Bulk Import Users&quot; is the only action required. It is optional, but a best practice to add a &quot;Move Document&quot; action following the &quot;Bulk Import Users&quot; action so that the CSV file is moved to an archive folder after it has been processed. It can be moved to the Trash as well. When a Bulk Import Users Document Rule executes, the document rule log will indicate how many users were Added, Updated and Deleted.&amp;nbsp;User Bulk LoadCustomers using SSO can add Users to SpringCM using Directory Sync. Two components are required:Formatted CSV fileSpringCM&amp;nbsp;Document RuleWhat scenario best fits your needs?If you are using Single Sign On (SSO) this will allow you to setup a process that will sync users that are allowed to use SpringCM with the same directory that is used to verify SSO.&amp;nbsp;For first time customers if you have a large list of customers that you want added to your account at one time this will add them all at once.&amp;nbsp;Formatted CSV&amp;nbsp;The CSV file must have the following column headers:Email:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM&amp;nbsp;UsernameFirstName:&amp;nbsp;First Name of the new SpringCM UserLastName:&amp;nbsp;Last Name of the new SpringCM UserGroups:&amp;nbsp;This is a pipe (|) delimited list of Security and Distribution groups to which the new User should be added.&amp;nbsp; If a listed group does not exist SpringCM&amp;nbsp;will create it and add the user to it.Active: 'True' if the User should be added to SpringCM, otherwise add 'False.'How to create the Document Rule for Directory Sync:Select the Preference tab and click the Document Rules link.Click the Rule menu, and select New.Name the Rule, and select Document Added in the For Event field.Select In Folder Filter and use the Select button to choose a folder to which you will upload the CSV, and click Add.Select Has Name Like and enter '*.csv' in the field that appears. Click Add.Select the User Sync Action, and click Add.Click Save, and select Enable from the Rule menu to activate the Rule.Directory Sync will now take place when the CSV&amp;nbsp;is uploaded to the folder named in the Rule.Note: All Users added to SpringCM by Directory Sync will be assigned the Full Subscriber role. Account Administrators should manually adjust the role assignments of Full Subscribers, User Administrators, or Super Administrators.</content:encoded>

        <title>User Roles</title>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?&amp;nbsp;SpringCM user roles define what&amp;nbsp;the maximum level of access is that&amp;nbsp;a user has in your&amp;nbsp;environment.&amp;nbsp; Each user role has a defined set of capabilities.&amp;nbsp;There are&amp;nbsp;five user roles:Guests are the minimal user role in SpringCM, and maximally can upload or view documents in SpringCM. Use the Guest role when users only need to create (upload) documents, or view or&amp;nbsp;download&amp;nbsp;documents.&amp;nbsp; Guests can not move, edit, or share documents and can not participate in workflow. Guests can execute Searches and can fill out eForms, but not edit or create them. They are limited to changing their passwords in the Preferences tab. Guests cannot view or create reports or access the Address Book.Limited subscribers are similar to Guests; however, they can participate in workflows and edit documents within workflows.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Limited Subscribers&amp;nbsp;can execute Searches and can fill out eForms, but not edit or create them. They are limited to changing their passwords in the Preferences tab.&amp;nbsp;Limited Subscribers&amp;nbsp;cannot view or create reports or access the Address Book.&amp;nbsp;Full subscribers can view, edit, and upload documents. Use this role when a user needs full access to documents and workflow. Full Subscribers can execute but not create or edit reports, and have limited access to functionality in Preferences (Inbound Email and&amp;nbsp;Password and User&amp;nbsp;Preferences.) Full Subscribers are the most common type of users.User administrators have the ability to manage users and to administer certain account_level Preferences. User Administrators cannot create or edit Security Groups, but they can create and edit Distribution Groups.&amp;nbsp;Super Administrators should assign&amp;nbsp;this role to delegate administrative tasks within&amp;nbsp;a SpringCM account.&amp;nbsp;There can be&amp;nbsp;multiple User Administrators&amp;nbsp;per account.Super administrators are the highest level administrator in your SpringCM account. They have rights and access to everything in your SpringCM repository, including all users' home folders. Use this role when you designate a repository administrator.&amp;nbsp;There can be multiple super administrators per accountWhen is it used?You assign a User Role for each person who logs in to your SpringCM account, so the User Role is foundational to how any user is allowed to work in SpringCM. User Roles are also used when setting security on folders and documents.How are User Roles used?When creating a new user in SpringCM, you will be required to configure the user's role. Think about the maximum level of action they will be taking, and then assign the appropriate User Role which accommodates that level of action.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you are granting a client access to SpringCM, and all they will be doing are viewing documents, assign them a Guest user role.&amp;nbsp; If a person is a member of your internal team who will need to add new documents to SpringCM, as well as edit those documents, assign them a Full Subscriber user role.&amp;nbsp;When setting security on documents and folders, you can define access based on User Role. To learn more about defining access rights based on User Role refer to the knowledge article titled Security.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/what_is_springcm_missing_content</link>
        <description>SpringCM Business Sync:&amp;nbsp; What is Missing Content?</description>
        <content:encoded>SpringCM Business Sync:&amp;nbsp; What is Missing Content?Missing content is used to identify documents or folders that are in SpringCM that are not synchronized locally. &amp;nbsp;SpringCM Missing Content is only available for folders that contain content in SpringCM but not in the local folder. &amp;nbsp;When you select Missing Content, it retrieves only the documents and immediate folders that are not in the folder selected. &amp;nbsp;Nested folders are not shown.&amp;nbsp;Selecting it will show you content that does not exist locally but does exist in SpringCM. It only shows content for the immediate folder; it does not traverse down the tree to show missing content below the folder selected. Documents and folders may exist in this folder and each will have a link to it in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;How do I access SpringCM Missing Content?&amp;nbsp;Navigate to a folder that includes the Warning Icon (Conflict) and right click on the folder. If content exists in the folder in SpringCM but not locally, you will have the option to right click and Select SpringCM Missing Content.When you select this option, &amp;nbsp;a window will pop up that retrieves a listing of documents and folders that exist in SpringCM but not locally.Clicking on the folder or document will open up SpringCM and take you to the object selected.&amp;nbsp;This typically occurs because of an ignorable conflict but may be due to a mainline conflict.&amp;nbsp;Does this include age filtering?&amp;nbsp;No, Missing Content only accounts for documents that are not being synchronized due to a conflict. Documents that are not being synchronized because they fall beyond the outer extent of the age filter will not display.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What are SpringCM Attributes?</description>
        <content:encoded>What are SpringCM Attributes?Viewing and editing Attributes associated to a document can now be accomplished directly from documents from the Sync folder. This allows the user to participate in processes that utilize these capabilities without accessing the document in SpringCM.Users can view or edit attributes for synchronized documents in My SpringCM Files.&amp;nbsp; Documents that are not synchronized to SpringCM can not invoke SpringCM Attributes.What can be done with SpringCM Attributes?&amp;nbsp;Multiple attribute groups can be assigned to a documentIf the user only has access to view attributes, then the user cannot assign Attribute Groups or edit existing attribute values.If the user has access to edit attributes, then the user can assign Attribute groups or edit existing attribute values.Dynamic drop downs, drop downs, string, number, and date field types are supportedRead only fields are supportedRequired fields are supportedRepeating sets are supportedRepeating fields are supportedHow do I view or edit Attributes?&amp;nbsp;To view or edit attributes associate to a documentNavigate to a document in My SpringCM FilesSelect the documentRight click and select SpringCM AttributesSpringCM Attributes for a document will be displayed.By default, you can see basic attributes of a documentYou will be able to view attributes that are assigned to a document. (View)You will be able to add Attribute Groups to a document if you have permissions &amp;nbsp;(View, Edit)You will be able to edit attributes of a given attribute group if you have permissions. (View, Edit)What works differently than in the SpringCM Web client?&amp;nbsp;Be aware of the following when working with Attributes in Sync.Attributes are not viewable or editable when not connected to the internetCascading attributes currently act as free form text fields and do not validate against the data supplied in the account.Attribute groups once assigned to a document cannot be unassigned.Any Attribute group can be assigned to documents in a folder even though the administrator has restricted a set of Attributes groups to a specific folder in SpringCMDefault Attribute values can not be set for a folder in SpringCM&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To initiate an advanced searchTo enter search criteriaTo specify search scopeTo search specific properties or attributesAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?The Advanced Search capabilities of SpringCM allow you to execute document and folder searches with a greater degree of granularity than the Basic Search.&amp;nbsp; The highly configurable Advanced Search&amp;nbsp;enables you to specify the search scope, the content properties or attributes that should be searched, and also to perform OR, phrase, and missing text searches.When is it used?Use an Advanced Search whenever you need to search for folders, search within a specific folder,&amp;nbsp; target specific content properties or attributes for the search or conduct an OR search or a search for missing text.If you do a Basic Search that is returning to many results, use Advanced Search to narrow the search results by specifying additional search criteria.How is it used?To initiate an advanced searchThere are two ways to invoke an advanced search:Select GOTO then Search from the menu barExecute a Basic Search. The advanced search options are displayed above the search results list for you to provide additional advanced search criteria.To enter search criteriaThere are four fields for entering the words that you want to search for. Choose the field which determines how you want the words to be interpreted relative to each other. The fields are:With all of these words _ This creates an AND relationship between the words. For example, entering software contract will find only documents containing both the words software AND contractWith any of these words _ This creates an OR relationship between the words. For example, entering software contract will find any documents with either the word software OR contract, including documents that contain both.With this phrase _ This will treat the words entered as a phrase. It is equivalent to entering a quoted string. For example, entering software contract will find only documents which have the phrase &quot;software contract&quot; in it.Without these words _ Specifying a word in this field will eliminate any document from the search results that contains the specified word. If more than one word is specified, any document containing either of the two words will be eliminated, such that it is interpreted as &quot;this or that word&quot;If you enter text into more than one of these fields, please note that all criteria must be met in order for the document to be returned in the search hit list. For example, if you're searching for either proposals or quotes for the company WorldClass Enterprises, enter WorldClass Enterprises in the With this Phrase field and proposal quote in the With any of these Words field. This will be interpreted as &quot;search for all documents containing the phrase WorldClass Enterprises and having either the word proposal or quote in it.&quot;See the knowledge article titled Search Tips for additional information and examples on how to enter search criteria.To specify search scopeBy default, a search is conducted against the most recent version of all documents in the account to which the current user has access. This is referred to as the search scope. The search scope determines the pool of content or objects that will be searched for the specified criteria.Limit by Folder: You can limit the search scope to a single folder or a folder tree so as to provide more targeted search results&amp;nbsp; To limit your search scope in this manner:On the Advanced Search page, expand the section called ContentCheck Limit search to folderClick Select A FolderOn the Select Items Dialog, navigate to the desired folder, and place a check mark in front of the folder name.Click Select to choose the checked folder and close the dialog. The selected folder will be placed in the Advanced Search dialogIf you want to include subfolders of the selected folder in the search (i.e., search the entire folder tree), check And Its SubfoldersExpected Results: With this option selected, when you execute the search it will no longer search the entire account, it will only search the selected folder or folder tree for the search criteria you specified in the other advanced search fields.Include Folders: You can expand the search scope to include folders as well as documents. To expand your search scope in this manner.On the Advanced Search page, expand the section called ContentCheck Folders under the heading called Search For:If you only want to include folders in the search, uncheck Documents.Include Revisions: You can also expand the search scope to include prior versions. To expand your search scope in this manner:On the Advanced Search page, expand the section called PropertiesCheck Include All RevisionsTo search specific properties or attributesBy default, a search will be executed against all of the following content areas:the body of the documentthe document namethe document descriptionlogin ID of the user who last modified the documentall of the document attributesIf you would like to search within a specific content area or a specific property, you can enter search criteria in the specific property or attribute that you want to search using the following as guidelines.Expand the Properties and Attributes sections of the Advanced Search page.Type the text that you want to search for in each or any of the content areas._ Entering text in Title will search for that text only in the document name._ Entering text in Content will search for that text only in the body of the document._ Entering text in Description will search for that text only in the document description.To search for only documents of a certain type, use the Document Extensions drop down to specify a list of document types to return. If you do not like one of the pre_defined categories, select other, and specify the document types you want returned based on the file extension (i.e., XLSX DOCX will return both Word 2010 and Excel 2010 documents)To search for only documents edited by a specific person, use the Modified By field to specify the SpringCM User Login ID that you want to search for.To search for only documents edited within a specific timeframe, Click the calendar icons located next to the Modified Between fields to specify the date range between which the document is to have been edited.To search for only documents with a certain value in any Attribute field, type that text in the In any Attribute Field located in the Attributes section.To search for only documents with a certain value in a specific attribute field, you must first add the attribute group to the Advanced Search page. Use the Add Attribute Group drop_down to select the attribute group to add.Once the attribute group has been added to the Advanced Search page, you can search for only documents with a certain value in a specific attribute field by typing the search text in the specific attribute field.If you enter text into more than one property or attribute please note that all criteria must be met in order for the document to be returned in the search hit list. That is, it will be interpreted as an AND relationship or &quot;documents having this property AND that property.&quot;See the knowledge article titled Search Tips for additional information and examples on how to enter search criteria.Advanced ConceptsPhrase Searching _ As mentioned in the section above, you can search for a phrase using the With this Phrase field. However, this method will not work if you want to search a specific attribute or property for a phrase. Therefore, if you would like to search a specific phrase, you can alternatively specify the phrase you want to search for by simply putting the phrase in double quotes ( &quot; ).&amp;nbsp; For example, entering &quot;WorldClass Enterprises&quot; into the Content field will search for the phrase WorldClass Enterprises in the body of the document. This rule applies to all text entry fields on the Advanced Search page.Stemming _ The SpringCM search engine performs stemming by default when providing results so that a search on something like apples will not exclude documents that contain only the singular form apple, or vice versa. If you would like SpringCM to not employ stemming for a specific word, you can enclose that word in double quotes ( &quot; ), and it will search only on the exact word. Please note that phrase searches that are enclosed in quotes will not use stemming, and will return only exact matches. See the knowledge article titled Search Tips for additional information and examples on how stemming will work.Wildcard Searching _ When specifying a word to search, use the asterisk character ( * ) as a wildcard if only part of a word is known. A wildcard can be placed at the beginning of the text string, in the middle of a text string, at the end of the text string, or a combination of all. It represents one or more unknown letters. See the knowledge article titled Search Tips for additional information and examples on how to enter search criteria.Case Sensitivity _ All searches in SpringCM are case insensitive. That is, search criteria can be entered in either upper or lower case, and it will return results which contain hits for either upper or lower case text.Stop Words _ The SpringCM Search Engines removes commonly used words during indexing, such that they are not relevant during searching and are automatically removed from the search query. Refer to the knowledge article titled Springcm Search Stop Words for a list of these commonly used words.Exclude Attribute groups _ All attributes in all attribute groups are automatically included as a content area that will searched. If you want to perform a search, but eliminate the attributes in an attribute group from the search you can do this by first adding the attribute group to the Advanced Search Form, then check Exclude this group. If the group is excluded, no attempt will be made to match the search criteria against the attributes of the group.Saved Searches _ Criteria selected from an Advanced Search can be saved to be re_used with one_click. See the knowledge article titled Saved Search for more information on how to create and use a saved search.Remove an Attribute Group Section _ If you add an attribute group to the Advanced Search screen and determine that it is no longer necessary, simply click the X on the attribute group section header, and the section will be deleted from the Advanced Search page.Full_Text Search Limitations _ If you are having problems searching for a document using a full_text search, then it could be that the file was not indexed due to a size limitation. See the knowledge article titled Upload, Download and Conversion Limits for details.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>SpringCM Edit Conflict Resolution</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/springcm_edit_conflict_resolution</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Advanced ConceptsWhat is it?A conflict can arise if two users edit the same document at the same time. When this occurs, SpringCM will prompt the user with a conflict resolution dialog providing them with options for how to handle the conflicting edits. This will resolve the conflict and provide a way for the user to save his or her edits.When is it Used?When a document is opened for editing using SpringCM Edit it is, by default, not locked for exclusive access. This allows more than one user to simultaneously open and edit the document. When simultaneous edits occur, edits from one of the users will be checked in as a new version, and edits from the other user(s) will introduce a conflict because SpringCM will prevent these edits from being checked in as a new version. At this time the user will receive a conflict resolution dialog upon save seeking input on how to handle the conflicting edits.How is it used?Upon any attempt to check_in a new version of a document, SpringCM will check to see if another user has created a more recent version since it was originally opened for editing. If it detects such a version, it will not be able to create a new version, and the user who has attempted to save subsequent edits will be prompted with a conflict resolution dialog seeking instructions on how to handle the edits.To resolve the edit conflict:Optional: Expand the Show Details panel to get additional information about the conflicting edits to help you make your decision.Choose from one of the options for how to handle the conflictOverwrite  This will replace the edits made in SpringCM with those made by you, creating a new version which contains only your edits and discarding any edits made by the other use. The edits made by the other user will be found in a previous version.Rename  This will save the edits made by you as a new document in SpringCM, and the current version of the original document in SpringCM will contain the edits of the other user.Discard  This will discard your edits and the current version of the original document in SpringCM will be contain the edits of the other user.&amp;nbsp;When you have selected an option, click the Resolve Button to complete the operation.Advanced ConceptsHandling your edits after a rename _ If you choose the rename option to save your new edits, you can still create a new version of the original document with your edits after the fact by checking out the original document, then checking in your new document from the SpringCM repository as a new version of the original document. See Check In and Check Out for additional information.Handling edits after an overwrite _ If you choose the overwrite option, and then want to see what changes were made by the other user so they can be incorporated your version, you can use the SpringCM Document Comparison feature to compare two versions.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to change default program associationsWhat is it?The default program association is what Microsoft Windows uses to determine which local application will be used to open a document downloaded using SpringCM Edit based on its document type or extension. For example, the default program association for files with an extension of .docx is Microsoft Word.When is it used?If a default program association is not setup or is not setup correctly, then documents that are downloaded and opened using SpringCM Edit may not open in a local application or they will open in the incorrect application.Refer to this knowledge article if you need to setup a new default program association or if you need to correct a default program association that is set incorrectly.How to change default program associationsTo correct this, please perform the following actions:From within Microsoft Windows (versions 7 or 8), navigate to the Control Panel.Select Default Programs (if you do not see this option, it may be because you are in Category view. Change your view to Large or Small Icons to see it)Select Associate a File Type or Protocol with a programNavigate the list of file extensions to find the extension that you want to change.Highlight the extension that you want to change.Click the Change Program button.Find and select the appropriate program to open this extension.Save your selection</content:encoded>

        <title>SpringCM Edit</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/springcm_edit</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Advanced ConceptsWhat is it?The SpringCM Edit application simplifies the process of editing and creating versions of a SpringCM document. It is as simple as selecting a document and clicking edit. With this single click, SpringCM Edit will download and open the document in the native application for editing, and check in new versions as the user completes and saves his or her edits in that native application.When is it used?The SpringCM Edit feature is the most widely used method for editing documents in SpringCM because of its ease of use. It is typically used for business documents created using productivity applications like Microsoft Office, but can be used for any document type that is not blacklisted as long as the user has edit rights to the document and the selected document type can be opened for editing on the local machine using a local application.SpringCM Edit requires:Installation and activation of a local SpringCM Edit application on the local computer; andInstallation of a local application which allows the selected document type to be opened and edited.SpringCM Edit should not be used when the user desires exclusive edit rights, or when he or she is working from a public computer that does not have the required local applications installed. Under these conditions, the recommended feature for editing documents is Check_out and Check_in.How is it Used?Using SpringCM Edit requires installation and activation of the SpringCM Edit application on the local computer. When the user selects the SpringCM Edit feature it will check to see if the application is installed, and if it is not, it will initiate the installation. It is recommended, but not required, that your organization plan for installation of the SpringCM Edit application prior to deployment to the end user. Please see SpringCM Edit Download for instructions on how to download, install and activate the SpringCM Edit application.To Edit a Document using One_Click EditClick the Documents tab and navigate to the folder containing the desired documentSelect the desired document by clicking its check box in the document list, OR click on the document to open it in Preview Mode.Select File then Edit Document from the menu barNote: It will check to see if the SpringCM Edit application is installed. If it is not, it will prompt the user to complete the download, installation and activation. Please see SpringCM Edit Download for instructions if prompted.The document will be downloaded locally to the default download directory of your browser and opened in the default native application registered in your local computer operating system for that file type.&amp;nbsp;Edit your document in the native application.When finished, save and close your document.Expected Results: The updated document will be uploaded into SpringCM and checked in as a new version.Advanced ConceptsConflict Resolution _&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Edit does not checkout or lock the document upon download and open, and the document will be available for revision by other users while it is open for editing by you. Since more than one user can simultaneously open and edit the document it can lead to conflicting edits. When simultaneous edits occur, each user will receive a conflict resolution dialog upon save seeking input on how to handle the conflicting edits. See SpringCM Edit Conflict Resolution for details on how to handle these conflicts.Guaranteeing Exclusive Edit Access _&amp;nbsp; Use the Check Out and Check In features when you want to ensure exclusive edit access and avoid simultaneous edits and conflicts.Creating Versions _ SpringCM Edit will monitor activity on the document while it is open for editing and automatically create a new version of the document in SpringCM each time the document is saved within the local application.History/Audit Trail _ When SpringCM Edit determines that changes have been saved to the open document it will create a new version, and an implicit check_in occurs to create and upload the new version of the document. This action will be logged in the document history as a document check_in via the SpringCM Web Service.Creating a toolbar button for SpringCM Edit _ If your organization plans to use SpringCM Edit and has made preparations to deploy the SpringCM Edit local application for easy editing, you may also want to consider adding this option to the toolbar. The Edit Document option, available on the File menu bar is not on the toolbar by default, making it less obvious for your users. Refer to Custom Menus and Toolbars for instructions on how to add Edit Document to the toolbar.Multiple Accounts _ Most SpringCM customers have a single account, but if your organization has multiple accounts, SpringCM Edit provides support for multiple SpringCM accounts allowing you to edit documents from each account using a single installation of the SpringCM Edit local application.Changing your SpringCM Edit Login for Testing _ If you will be testing an upcoming release of SpringCM using SpringCM Edit and need to modify your login to test in our UAT environment, please review to the knowledge article titled SpringCM Edit Toggle between UAT and PROD for instructions on how to accomplish this.Replacement for WebDAV Edit _ For customers who are familiar with the old SpringCM feature for WebDAV Edit, please note that WebDAV Edit has been retired and SpringCM Edit replaces it.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>SpringCM Business Sync Overview</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/springcm_business_sync_overview</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?SpringCM Business Sync is an application that allows you to access SpringCM right from your desktop. Documents can be added, viewed, edited, saved and deleted straight from your laptop or desktop without ever needing to log into SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;You can choose which folders you are interested in syncing to your desktop and manage folders right from Sync. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Business Sync even allows for the update of descriptions and tagging of attributes straight from sync. &amp;nbsp;Once folders, files and the information associated to them are synced, they are always available to you and you can work with the documents even when you are offline. &amp;nbsp;Once you are back on the internet, these files will be synced with your SpringCM account when you reopen you Sync client. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Best of all, the documents and folders you have access to, along with the security right you have on those documents and folders tie directly into your SpringCM account so if you have permission to do something in SpringCM, you will be able to do so in Sync. &amp;nbsp;The only exception to this is when sync include rules or exclude rules have been applied by administrators. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Sync is most commonly used when you need easy access to a few folders and files that you work the most frequently with. &amp;nbsp;It is also a great way option for users who do not like logging into SpringCM to work because the synced SpringCM folders look and behave like any other folder on a user's desktop.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How is it used?There are many resources available to you to help you get started with SpringCM Business Sync. &amp;nbsp;Please see our resources below. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Business Sync Windows Installation FilesDownload SpringCM Business Sync for Windows 32_bit InstallerDownload SpringCM Business Sync for Windows 64_bit Installer&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Business Sync VideosSpringCM Business Sync for Windows Installation&amp;nbsp;_ &amp;nbsp;Walks through how to install the ApplicationSpringCM Business Sync for Windows Getting Around&amp;nbsp;_ &amp;nbsp;Walks through the App and where everything isSpringCM Business Sync for Windows Setup and Configuration_ Walks through authorizing the app for usage and folder selectionSpringCM Business Sync for Windows Conflict Resolution_ &amp;nbsp;Walks through how to manage conflicts and what you should do if you exceed your Subscription LimitSpringCM Business Sync Web Client Configuration and Rules Configuration_ Walks through enabling Desktop Sync for your Account and how to configure Business Rules(&amp;nbsp;For the SpringCM Account Administrator)&amp;nbsp;Release NotesCurrent Release Notes&amp;nbsp;_ &amp;nbsp;Provides an overview of what has changed with the current release of SpringCM Business Sync</content:encoded>

        <title>SpringCM  Salesforce Folder Structure Creation Guide</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/springcm_salesforce_folder_structure_creation_guide</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it setup?What is it?SpringCM can be added to any standard or custom Salesforce object so that documents can be associated, viewed, and managed within the object record. Each object record is given its own folder in SpringCM, so the objects must be identified and folder structure must be defined.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Configuring a SpringCM folder for a Salesforce object will allow you to view and manage documents within the object record.&amp;nbsp;Note:&amp;nbsp; The SpringCM Free Edition is restricted to only 2 Salesforce objects.&amp;nbsp;How is it setup?In the App Menu, select&amp;nbsp;SpringCM.In the&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Setup&amp;nbsp;tab, select&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Environment.&amp;nbsp;Production&amp;nbsp;should always be selected for the&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Free Edition. Click&amp;nbsp;Next.Define SpringCM Folder Path and Folder Name for Salesforce objects.Click the&amp;nbsp;Add New Folder Portal Widget&amp;nbsp;link.From the drop down menu, choose the Salesforce object that will incorporate SpringCM.Define&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Folder Path. The folder path is used to establish a folder structure and even relate documents for objects that share a parent/child relationship.&amp;nbsp;For objects that are not linked, follow the examples below.&amp;nbsp;If the objects are linked (share a parent/child relationship), you can relate documents together through connected subfolders. From the parent object like an Account, you can access the documents of a linked child object like an Opportunity. To do this, the folder path for the child object must reference the parent lookup field.&amp;nbsp;Define&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Folder Name. This is how the folder for each object record will be named and will always refer to a field of that object. The folder name is typically the name of the object record:&amp;nbsp;{!Name}. Naming a folder by a custom field would be formatted this way:{!Object.Custom_Field__c}.Save&amp;nbsp;and look for&amp;nbsp;confirmation of a valid folder path.NOTES:The {!ParentObject.Name} is a lookup or master_detail relationship and must be a field on the child object in order to link it to the parent object. This will not work with a related list like Contacts to Opportunities.Object fields referenced in the folder path should be required fields.The Lead object is not recommended if records are converted to Contacts, as the documents will not move</content:encoded>

See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for a general discussion of Smart Rules.When is it Used?Filters are only applicable when defining Document Smart Rules (as opposed to Scheduled Document Smart Rules).How is it Used?When defining a Document Smart Rule, at least one filter condition must be provided, unless the event type for the Document Smart Rule is type Chained (see the knowledge article titled Chained Document Smart Rules for more information).More than one filter condition can be put in a single Smart Rule. If more then one filter condition exists, then the filters will be evaluated with either an AND or OR relationship.Filters of the same filter type are evaluated with an OR relationship (e.g., in this folder OR in that folder).Filters of different filter types are evaluated with an AND relationship, and both conditions must be met (e.g., in this folder AND with name like &quot;contract&quot;)If the Exclusive option is checked, then the filter condition will be evaluated for the absence of the specified parameter. For example, if the filter type is Has Attribute Value and you are checking for the value of &quot;OPEN&quot; in the Status Attribute and you check the Exclusive option, it will check for documents where Status is NOT &quot;OPEN&quot;The table below provides details on each of the available filter types, and specifies what additional parameters will be required when you select that filter type.

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/smart_rules_events</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Additional ReferencesWhat is it?An Event is used when defining a Smart Rule to determine what will trigger the Smart Rule to run. See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for a general discussion of Smart Rules.When is it Used?The Event is only applicable when defining a Document Smart Rule (as opposed to a Scheduled Document Smart Rule).How is it Used?When defining a Document Smart Rule, an Event will be selected from the list of valid Events. There are different Event types:Document  These events are fired based on document activity. They are available only for selection when defining a Document Smart Rule.Chained  his is a special case and is not an event at all. It indicates that the Smart Rule will be part of set of Smart Rules that will be triggered by a master Smart Rule rather than triggered by an individual event. See the knowledge article titled Chained Document Smart Rules for more information.Scheduled  This is a special case and is not an event at all. It is assumed when the user creates a Scheduled Smart Rule, and cannot be selected from the drop down. It is described below because it will appear in the Smart Rule list as the Event. &amp;nbsp;The table below provides details on each of the Events. Refer to this table when defining Events on your Smart Rules.EventEvent TypeDescriptionDocument AddedDocumentThis event is fired when a document is initially added or uploaded to SpringCM.Document Check InDocumentThis event is fired when a new version of a document is uploaded to a folder, which is considered a check_in.Document Entered FolderDocumentThis event is fired when a document is copied, moved or uploaded to a folderAttribute Group AssignedDocumentThis event is fired when any previously defined attribute group is applied to a particular document. When using this event, it is best practice to add one or more filters for Assigned Attribute Group, so that the event will apply to only the specified attribute group(s).Attribute Value ChangedDocumentThis event is fired when any attribute value within any attribute group is changed. When using this event, it is best practice to add one or more filters for Changed Attribute Field, so that the event will apply to only the specified attribute fields(s).Document IndexedDocumentA document is submitted for indexing anytime there is a change to the document properties, document attributes or versioned. This event is fired when the queued index action is completed.ChainedChainedThis option does not actually monitor for any events. It is specified only when the Smart Rule will be called by another Smart Rule as part of a chain.On ScheduleScheduledThis option is not selectable when defining a Smart Rule. It is assumed when the user creates a Scheduled Smart Rule. It indicates that the Smart Rule is run based on the configured schedule.Document Reminder ProcessedDocumentThis trigger occurs when a document reminder that was applied to a document or set of documents is sent (reminder email to a group of recipients based on the parameters of the reminder).When selecting document events, please note that the events will run for any document. Therefore, it is considered a best practice to utilize filters to limit the scope of the Document Smart Rule. For example, when looking for documents that are added, add an In Folder or In Subfolder filter to limit it to only documents in the specified folder(s).Additional ReferencesThe following knowledge articles provide additional details which will help you to create and work with Smart Rules:Smart RulesSmart Rules: FiltersSmart Rules: ActionsSmart Rules: Common Use CasesChained Document Smart Rules</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create a document ruleTo create a scheduled ruleTo enable or disable a ruleAdvanced ConceptsAdditional ReferencesWhat is it?The SpringCM Smart Rules feature provides an easy_to_use interface for automating actions on a folder or document based on events that occur in that folder or with that document. It is a very powerful feature that allows your organization to do significant process automation with little or no training.When is it used?Use a Smart Rule whenever you encounter a repetitive task that you would like to automate so as to eliminate human intervention or to trigger larger or more advanced workflows.For example, a Smart Rule can trigger&amp;nbsp;an invoice to automatically move from a Pending Approval folder to a Approved Invoices folder when an invoice approver marks the invoice as approved using a document attribute. The same Smart Rule can also apply an attribute group, attribute values or security to the invoice after it is moved to the Approved Invoices folder.A Smart Rule is a common way to kick off a SpringCM Advanced Workflow process as well, as it monitors for the event necessary to trigger the start of the workflow.A Smart Rule is also commonly used to automate administrative tasks such as Address Book management (i.e. adding, editing, and deleting users) and Attribute Group Management (i.e., adding values from an external system to an attribute in an attribute group).These are just a few examples of how the powerful Smart Rules feature can be used to automate processes within your organization. For additional examples, see our knowledge article titled Smart Rules: Common Use Cases.How is it used?To create a Document RuleUse a Document Rule when you want to monitor for an event on a document or in a folder that will trigger a specified action. You must be a SpringCM Super Administrator to create a Smart RuleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from within the Account Preferences section of the tree.Select Rule then New Document Rule from the menu bar.Type in a descriptive name for the rule in the Name field (required).Use the Event drop down to select the document event that should trigger the rule. See the knowledge article on Events for details on the meaning of each of the available events.Define the User ID that should be used to execute the specified after the event has been detected and the rule triggered from among the following options:Initiator _ the person who was logged in and took the action that resulted in the event. For example, if JSmith uploaded a document to a folder, and the event was Document Added, then the action would be run as if JSmith were taking the action. Use this option to reflect the actual user who took the action. When using this option you need to make sure that the user will have access to the objects required to complete the action and that the user ID will not be disabled. Since this is not guaranteed, it is considered a best practice to use one of the other two options.{Your ID} _ As a Super Administrator who is defining the rule, you can indicate that your User ID should be used to complete the specified action. Use this option if the action requires access that the user who initiated the event would not have.Specific User _ the action will be run as if this specific user were taking the action. Use this option when specific access rights are required, and you do not want to capture the actual user who took the action.Use the Filter drop down to select a Filter type. This will limit the scope of folders, documents or attribute groups that will be monitored for the specified event. See the knowledge article on Filters for details on the meaning of each of the available filter type.For each Filter Type there is a requirement to provide additional details which will define the scope for that Filter type. For example, if the filter type is In Folder you will need to provide a folder name, or if the filter type is With Attribute Group, you will need to provide an attribute group name. Type in the required scope based on the Filter type as required.Click the Add Filter to add the defined filter to the filter list.If you want to add additional filters, repeat steps 7 and 9 for the new filter type. If you add more then one filter, then the filters will be evaluated with either an AND or OR relationship. Filters of the same filter type are evaluated with an OR relationship (e.g., in this folder OR in that folder). Filters of different filter types are evaluated with an AND relationship, and both conditions must be met (e.g., in this folder AND with name like &quot;contract&quot;)Use the Actions drop down to select an action. This will define the action that should be executed as the specified user when the event is detected within the scope of the specified filters. See the knowledge article on Actions for details on the meaning of each of the available Action.For each action there is a requirement to provide additional details which will define the necessary parameters for the action. For example, if the action is Move Document you will need to provide a folder name, or if the action is Set Security, you will need to provide the security definition. Type in the required parameters based on the action as required.Click Add Action to add the defined action to the Action Sequence.If you want to execute more than one action, repeat steps 11_13 for the new action. If you add more then one action, all actions will be execute when the event occurs within the scope of the specified filters.Reorder your actions using the up and down arrows in the Action Sequence if necessary.When you are finished defining your rule, click SaveTip: Next to the Save button there is an option called Analyze. Clicking Analyze will check for and report on problems with your rule definition. It is best practice to check your rule prior to save.Expected Results: The rule will be created and added to the rule list as a disabled rule. The rule list will display the name, the events, the filters and the actions that make up the rule.To create a Scheduled RuleUse a Scheduled Rule when you want to run a Smart Rule at a specific time. You must be a SpringCM Super Administrator to create a Smart RuleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from within the Account Preferences section of the tree.Select Rule then New Scheduled Rule from the menu bar.Type in a descriptive name for the rule in the Name field (required).Define the User ID that should be used to execute the specified actions. See definitions above for additional information.In the Schedule section, select a pre_defined schedule from the drop down. If you do not see a pre_defined schedule, then the SpringCM Super Administrator will need to create one. See the knowledge article titled Schedules for instructions on how to create a schedule.Use the Actions drop down to select an action. This will define the action that should be executed as the specified user when the event is detected within the scope of the specified filters. See the knowledge article on Actions for details on the meaning of each of the available Action.For each action there is a requirement to provide additional details which will define the necessary parameters for the action. For example, if the action is Move Document you will need to provide a folder name, or if the action is Set Security, you will need to provide the security definition. Type in the required parameters based on the action as required.Click Add Action to add the defined action to the Action Sequence.If you want to execute more than one action, repeat steps 11_13 for the new action. If you add more then one action, all actions will be execute when the event occurs within the scope of the specified filters.Reorder your actions using the up and down arrows in the Action Sequence if necessary.When you are finished defining your rule, click SaveTip: Next to the Save button there is an option called Analyze. Clicking Analyze will check for and report on problems with your rule definition. It is best practice to check your rule prior to save.Expected Results: The rule will be created and added to the rule list as a disabled rule. The rule list will display the name, the events, the filters and the actions that make up the rule.To Enable or Disable a RuleA rule is disabled by default upon creation. As SpringCM Administrator, you must enable the rule in order for it to run.Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from within the Account Preferences section of the tree.The list if defined rules will appear on the page. The status column will indicate if the rule is currently enabled or disabled.Check the rule(s) for which you want to the status.Select Rule then either Enable or Disable from the menu bar.Advanced ConceptsChaining _ Smart Rules can be chained together so that rules with different filter conditions and actions can be combined to fire based on a single event. See the knowledge article titled Chained Document Smart Rules for more information.Dynamic Attribute and Path Values _ When defining attribute and path values in Smart Rule actions it is often desirable to use dynamic values derived from document metadata in the value or the path name rather than a static value. This is accomplished in SpringCM Smart Rules using XPath.&amp;nbsp; Examples of how this is accomplished can be found in the knowledge article titled Smart Rules: Common Use Cases.Disabling of Scheduled Smart Rules _ When a scheduled rule runs, the schedule will be evaluated based on the effective dates configured in the schedule parameters. If it is determined that there is no valid future date on which the Smart Rule will run, then the Smart Rule will be marked as disabled automatically.Additional ReferencesThe following knowledge articles provide additional details which will help you to create and work with Smart Rules:Smart Rules: EventsSmart Rules: FiltersSmart Rules: ActionsSmart Rules: Common Use CasesChained Document Smart Rules&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to setup the Electronic Signature preferencesHow to send an Electronic Signature requestWhat history events are written?&amp;nbsp;What is it?Send for Electronic Signature&amp;nbsp;enables you to send a document for an electronic signature or physical signature from within the Documents workspace or Preview Mode.&amp;nbsp; Once the document is signed, it is stored SpringCM&amp;nbsp;as a PDF verified through Adobe_Echosign integrity protocols.&amp;nbsp;Send for Electronic Signature&amp;nbsp;allows for either a physical signature or an electronic signature.&amp;nbsp;If the sender prefers a physical signature, this option can be selected in the setup of the Send event.&amp;nbsp; With physical signature requests,&amp;nbsp;a bar coded cover page is appended to the document. After the signatory signs the document, they fax it back (including the bar code cover page).&amp;nbsp; Using the bar code on the cover sheet, SpringCM versions the signed document as a PDF.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Send for Electronic Signature is the default setting for the&amp;nbsp;action.&amp;nbsp; To note, the recipient does not have to be a SpringCM user _ the email address of the recipient can be entered freely.For SalesForce integrated users, this option is also on the context menu of the portal widget.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Send for Electronic Signature is used when a signature is needed on the document or is needed to move to the next step in a workflow.&amp;nbsp;How to setup the Electronic Signature preferencesPreferences &amp;gt; Account Preferences &amp;gt; Electronic SignatureIf you would like to use&amp;nbsp;your own&amp;nbsp;EchoSign account (ie.direct contract with EchoSign):Choose&amp;nbsp;I do have an EchoSign account in the&amp;nbsp;Electronic Signature Type field.Enter&amp;nbsp;EchoSign API Key, type in your account API key.Enter&amp;nbsp;Designated Sender&amp;nbsp;(i.e. email of the sender and is optional).Click&amp;nbsp;Save.&amp;nbsp;If you would like to use&amp;nbsp;SpringCMs&amp;nbsp;EchoSign account:Choose Use SpringCM's Signature Account.Click&amp;nbsp;Change Designated&amp;nbsp;to add the designated sender information.Under&amp;nbsp;Designated Sender, type in the desired senders email.Type in the first name of the sender under&amp;nbsp;First Name.Type in the last name of the sender under&amp;nbsp;Last Name.Select the option for who can send signature actions (Sender and Super Administrators OR any user with security privileges)Click&amp;nbsp;Save.Note: This is a paid feature.How to send an Electronic Signature requestClick the documents checkbox to select it.Click on&amp;nbsp;Send &amp;gt; For Electronic SignatureType in the recipients name(s) under&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To:.&amp;nbsp;Here you can add multiple recipients from the Address Book or the recipients can be free_form entered. Up to 25 recipients are allowed.By default, the order you enter the recipients will be the order that they are required to sign the document. &amp;nbsp;Optionally, you can allow any order for signature by selecting the checkbox in the options menu. &amp;nbsp;Type in a message, if desired.Evaluate and if necessaey, change the expiration date. The expiration is typically defaulted to 10 days from the initation but can be scheduled up to 120 days into the future.&amp;nbsp;If the document is not signed before the expiration date, the signature request will be automatically cancelled and the document will be checked back in to the SpringCM document repository.If you also need to sign the document, please include yourself and put yourself at the last of the list.By default, you will be able to preview the Electronic Signature in Echosign before sending by selecting Next.&amp;nbsp;The Echosign preview page will load. Here you can add, move, or change signature blocks.&amp;nbsp;When finished, please hit&amp;nbsp;Send&amp;nbsp;in the Echosign&amp;nbsp;page.&amp;nbsp;SpringCM will send the recipient(s) an email containing a secure link to sign the document through Adobe EchoSign. The sender and recipient will be notified by email as the process is completed.&amp;nbsp;What history events are written?&amp;nbsp;History Events are written in the following scenarios:When the document is sentout for signatureWhen the document is viewedWhen the document is signedWhen the document is rejectedWhen the document is cancelled.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?What are the contents of the archive file?What are the prerequisites?How to deploy?What are the override settings?What are the rules?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is it? The SpringCM Sync&amp;nbsp;scriptable installer&amp;nbsp;is a special form of installer which can be used in advanced scenarios where the administrator remotely installs the application to client workstation while specifying values for specific settings by default.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What are the contents of the archive file? Business Sync_.zip32 bit workstations64 bit workstationsThe &amp;nbsp;Business Sync.zip file contains:Folder vcredist_x64: Visual C ++ Redistributable PackageFolder FilesMSI installer:&amp;nbsp;SpringCM_Business_Sync.msiDeployed filesApplication files:&amp;nbsp;Folder Business SyncConfiguration templates:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;located under SpringCM Desktop Sync\DefaultConfigSetup boostrapper (setup.exe)  this is not part of the scriptable installer but can be used in certain situations under conditions when a .exe package can be pushed to clients.The MSI uses &quot;Uncompressed&quot; mode which allows the IT Administrator to change specific files which are part of the installation package. &amp;nbsp;See &quot;Overriding settings&quot; below. This means that the application files are not packed inthe MSI but instead are placed alongside the MSI installer.&amp;nbsp;The MSI installer can be pushed to client workstations typically by configuring a Group Policy object on the domain controller.&amp;nbsp;When SpringCM Edit is installed via the scriptable installer, the end user will need to do the following after the installation:Reboot the computerAccept the license agreementAuthorize the app to begin using it.What are the prerequisites?&amp;nbsp;The following prerequisites must be installed manually before pushing the package to end user workstations:Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable.NET 4.0 Full (9.0.30729) x86 or x64The .NET Framework 4.0 installer can be obtained from the Microsoft website or pushed to the client workstation using WSUS or some other mechanism.Web Installer:&amp;nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en_us/download/details.aspx?id=17851Stand alone Installer:&amp;nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en_us/download/details.aspx?id=17718If the user installs Sync&amp;nbsp;manually, these items are installed as part of the package.&amp;nbsp;If Sync&amp;nbsp;has been installed manually prior to the push installation, it should be completed uninstalled prior to completing a fresh installation of Edit.&amp;nbsp;How to deploy?The Push deployment is typically set up using Group Policy on the windows domain controller. This overview does not walk through configuring the MSI installer as each organization has different standards and requirements. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The MSI installer is a standard MSI package which means that it accepts standard msiexec parameters. It uses the silent switch by default when deployed using Group Policy. &amp;nbsp;Please refer to the following Knowledge Base Article:&amp;nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816102. When placing the MSI file on the server, the application files &amp;nbsp;found in the SpringCM folder need to be placed in a shared folder parallel to the MSI.&amp;nbsp;Each managed versions should have its own root folder. This ensures that the application be uninstalled or upgraded properly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What are ther override settings?Overridable settings can be found in x86_Release_SpringCM\Files\SpringCM\Edit\DefaultConfig folder &amp;nbsp;in the decompressed scriptable installer package. The user is able to change most settings after the application has been installed with the exception of Check for Updates. These settings templates are meant to minimize the number of steps that the user needs to perform after the installation is complete.Proxysettings.xml&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf_8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ProxySettings xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema_instance&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://springcm.net/schemas/syncclient/proxyconfig/v1&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Mode&amp;gt;Auto&amp;lt;/Mode&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Url&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Url&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Port&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Port&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;RequiresAuthentication&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/RequiresAuthentication&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;UserName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/UserName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ProxySettings&amp;gt;XML NodeDescriptionModeo Proxy: Used if you do not access a proxy server to access resources on the internet. Choose this option if you do not use a proxy server. If you have a proxy server configured in Windows and this option is selected, then the Windows proxy configured will not be utilized.Auto_detect: Used if a proxy server is configured in Windows. Selecting Auto_detect is used when the Proxy is setup in LAN Settings in WindowsManual:&amp;nbsp; Used typically by advanced users when a non_standard proxy server configuration has been implemented. SpringCM Sync only supports HTTP Proxy servers. SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 Proxy server implementations are not supported.UrlThis contains the URL or IP address of the proxy server. For example: 192.168.110.5PortThe port that the proxy server is setup to listen at.

For example: true, falseUserNameThe username can be setup in the templates but this is not reqiored as the user is required to enter their username and password the first time the application is executed when Requires Authentication is set to true.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Options.xml&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;s:SyncClientSettings xmlns:s=&quot;http://springcm.net/schemas/syncclient/config/v1&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:NewVersionBehavior&amp;gt;CreateVersionOnSave&amp;lt;/s:NewVersionBehavior&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:SynchronizationPerformance&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/s:SynchronizationPerformance&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:AutomaticUpdates&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/s:AutomaticUpdates&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:AutomaticStartup&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/s:AutomaticStartup&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:ShowNotifications&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/s:ShowNotifications&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:RetentionIntervalDays&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/s:RetentionIntervalDays&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:UseSSO&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/s:UseSSO&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:MaxMailBodyLength&amp;gt;1400&amp;lt;/s:MaxMailBodyLength&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:AutomaticUpdateCheckIntervalDays&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/s:AutomaticUpdateCheckIntervalDays&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:IsDiagnosticLoggingEnabled&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/s:IsDiagnosticLoggingEnabled&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:UpdateCheckMode&amp;gt;Normal&amp;lt;/s:UpdateCheckMode&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:NotificationPollingIntervalMinutes&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/s:NotificationPollingIntervalMinutes&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:CheckinReminderIntervalMinutes&amp;gt;10&amp;lt;/s:CheckinReminderIntervalMinutes&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:EnableCheckinReminder&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/s:EnableCheckinReminder&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:FolderSelectionMode&amp;gt;SelectParent&amp;lt;/s:FolderSelectionMode&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;s:WelcomeWizardFinished&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/s:WelcomeWizardFinished&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/s:SyncClientSettings&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;XML NodeDescriptionNewVersionBehaviorThis is used to identify if Sync prompts the user on Save when they want to create a new version or if new version is automatically created on Save. For example: CreateVersiononSave or CreateVersionLaterSynchronizationPerformanceThis is used to identify how often Sync checks for changes in SpringCM. For example: 1: Low Performance, Checks every minute and uses 1 thread2: Medium Performance, Checks every 30 seconds and uses 5 threads3: High Performance, Checks every 15 seconds and uses 25 threadsAutomaticUpdatesThis is used to identify if Sync checks for automatic updates. When the application is being pushed to remote clients, this should be Disabled.&amp;nbsp;AutomaticStartupThis is used to identify if Sync starts automatically when Windows launches. For example: true, false.ShowNotificationsThis is used to identify if Sync presents bubble notifications to the user when events occur. For example: true, false.RetentionIntervalDaysThis is used to identify if Sync keeps content locally if content has not changed in SpringCM. For example, if the value is set to 30, then if a document has not been changed within the last 30 days it will not be synchronized down to the desktop.&amp;nbsp;UseSSOThis is used to identify if the user accesses a Single Sign On Identify provider or if they access SpringCM via the SprinCM login page. For example: true, false.MaxMailBodyLengthThis is used to identify how large the mail message can be when the user is sharing links form Sync via the SpringCM Share right click option.&amp;nbsp;AutomaticUpdateCheckIntervalDaysThis is not relevant given that AutomaticUpdates should be set as DisabledIsDiagnosticLoggingEnabledBy default this is set to false. It should only be set as true if an issue has occurred that requires analysis by SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;UpdateCheckModeBy default this is set to Normal. &amp;nbsp;Normal indicates that the user can manually check for updates manually as well as have Automatic Updates enabled. If Disabled, then the user will not see in the client the ability to manually check for updates. Automatic updates is also disabled.&amp;nbsp;NotificationPollingINternalMinutesThis identifies how often Sync interrogates SpringCM for new notifications.&amp;nbsp;CheckinreminderNotificationIntervalMinutesIf documents are checked out in SpringCM or saved locally but not updated, this reminds the user that documents exist that need to be updatef in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;EnableCheckinReminderIf documents are checked out in SpringCM or saved locally but not updated, this identifies if the user receives a reminder.&amp;nbsp;FolderSelectionModeThis determines if &amp;nbsp;the parent folder is selected when the user selects folders for synchronization. For example, SelectParent,DoNoSelectParent.WelcomeWizardFinishedThis determines if the Welcome Wizard needs to be walked through by the user after the install is complete. For example, false or true.What are the rules?Typically the configuration templates are used as a means of first configuration. They cannot be used to enforce specific configuration on an end machine.The configuration templates are installed by the MSI installer under %APPDATA%\SpringCM\SpringCM Desktop Sync\DefaultConfig\The following rules apply:First start after installApplication picks up the default settings and makes these per_user settings (per user settings are located under %APPDATA%\SpringCM\SpringCM Desktop Sync\UpgradeDefaultConfig will be updated from the distribution server, but application will not pick the new settings (it will continue using the existing per_user settings)Re_configurationThe user can come back to the setting template by manually deleting per_user settings while sync is not running and restarting sync.The Administrator should disable checking for automatic updates and should push updates to SpringCM Sync based on defining the GPO Policy. &amp;nbsp;You can disable checking for auomatic updates by setting&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;s:UpdateCheckMode&amp;gt;Disabled&amp;lt;/s:UpdateCheckMode&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to setup Electronic Signature preferencesHow to send an Electronic Signature request&amp;nbsp;What is it?Send for Electronic Signature&amp;nbsp;enables you to send a document for an electronic signature or physical signature from within the Documents workspace or Preview Mode.&amp;nbsp; Once the document is signed, it is stored back in SpringCM&amp;nbsp;as a PDF verified through&amp;nbsp;DocuSign integrity protocols.&amp;nbsp;When a user sends a document out for Signature, SpringCM connects to DocuSign on behalf of that user as the designated sender and&amp;nbsp; initiates the send for signature process.&amp;nbsp; The email that is received by the recipient comes specifically from the sender that initiated the process in SpringCM, not the designated sender. Additionally, every user that needs to send a document from SpringCM via Docusign needs to exist in the address books of both SpringCM and DocuSign.Send for Electronic Signature&amp;nbsp;allows for either a physical signature or an electronic signature.&amp;nbsp;If the sender prefers a physical signature, this option can be selected in the setup of the Send event.&amp;nbsp; With physical signature requests,&amp;nbsp;a bar coded cover page is appended to the document. After the signatory signs the document, they fax it back (including the bar code cover page).&amp;nbsp; Using the bar code on the cover sheet, SpringCM versions the signed document as a PDF.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Send for Electronic Signature is the default setting for the&amp;nbsp;action.&amp;nbsp; To note, the recipient does not have to be a SpringCM user _ the email address of the recipient can be entered freely.For SalesForce integrated users, this option is also on the context menu of the portal widget.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Send for Electronic Signature&amp;nbsp;is used when a signature is needed on the document or is needed to move to the next step in a workflow.How to setup the Electronic Signature preferencesPreferences &amp;gt; Account Preferences &amp;gt; Electronic SignatureTo use&amp;nbsp;your own&amp;nbsp;DocuSign account (ie.direct contract with DocuSign):The DocuSign Account Administrator needs to identify and setup a user email address within Docusign that acts as a service account, much like an API user, that allows SpringCM to interact with DocuSign in initiating signature requests.&amp;nbsp; This user needs to have Account_Wide Rights and Send of Behalf of Rights.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Changing the password in Docusign for the user will require a change of the password in SpringCM.Select&amp;nbsp;I am a DocuSign Customer in the&amp;nbsp;Electronic Signature Type fieldEnter a Designated Sender&amp;nbsp;(i.e. email/user id).

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;After authorizing the application for use, one of the first steps performed is selecting folders to be synchronized between SpringCM and your local computer. Folders that are synchronized can be updated or changed at any time.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;When you wish to add or remove folders that are being synchronized between SpringCM and your computer you update your folder subscriptions. Reasons for changing subscriptions are varied but typically occur when you wish to sync other relevant content to your desktop, remove content that you no longer need, or hit your subscription limit.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?To change you subscription, perform the following steps:Open up SpringCM Business Sync Preferences PageSelect Select Folders.Upon selecting this, the Folder tree will load. &amp;nbsp;If only one account exists, then the Folder Tree will be automatically expanded for all root folders.Each Folder can be navigated through to the lowest level of the Folder Tree, if required.If multiple Accounts exist, then each Account will need to be expanded.As you look at the folder tree, you may notice folders that are greyed out and folders that contain an asterisk.&amp;nbsp;Select or de_select a set of folders as necessary.Select OK. This action will update your sync profile with the changes requested and begin processing the changes on your computer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Security Groups</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/security_groups</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create a security groupTo apply access to foldersWhat is it?The Security Group feature, located in the Address Book, enables you to create and modify one or more groups of SpringCM users which will be used to define access to folders. Each security group will consist of a list of users with similar document_access needs. A security group can consist of only licensed user accounts, and cannot have contacts in the group membership.When is it used?Security Groups are used to define access rights to folders in lieu of User Role (which may be too permissive for sensitive content) as well as in lieu of specifying individual users. Specifying access based on a group of users rather than User Role or by individuals greatly simplifies the process of defining and maintaining security access and it is the recommended best practice for managing document and folder access in your SpringCM account.&amp;nbsp;A Security Group can consist of any group of users who have similar document access requirements, but they often emulate department or project teams (e.g.., Human Resources, Sales and Marketing, Executive Team, Resume Processors, Project ABCD, etc.)Once a group of users is identified that have similar access needs, you just need to decide upon a group name, define the group, and finally assign the group access to the SpringCM folder.How is it Used?To create a Security GroupOnly your SpringCM account's Super Administrator has the ability to create or modify Security Groups.Select GOTO then Address Book from the menu bar.Click the Create Security Group button on the toolbar.Provide a name for the security group (required)Begin typing the name of a user or group in the field titled User or Group.Note: You cannot select contacts or distribution groups because contacts are not allow in a security group.When the name of the user or group appears in the drop down, click on that name or highlight and select it to add it to the new security group.Note: if you select a group name, all users from the selected group will be added to the new group.Click the Save button to create the security group.To apply access to foldersOnce the security group has been created, it can be used to define access to folders (and documents within those folders). You must be a super administrator or have been granted Set Access rights to the folder in order to manage the security on the folder.Select GOTO then Documents from the menu bar.Navigate to the folder for which you want to define access.Check the folder to select it.Select Manage then Security from the menu bar.Type the first few letters of the security group name in the field provided.When the name of the security group appears in the drop down, click on that name or highlight and select it to add it to role/group/user list below.In the drop down next to the security group name, choose the desired security level that you want members of the security group to have. Refer to the knowledge article titled Security for a detailed description of the available security options.Click the Save button to save your changes.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To set access rights on a folder/documentsEligible Candidates for security accessSecurity Access DefinitionsSecurity InheritanceView Permissions for All UsersDetermining a User's Security SettingsWhat is it?Security Overview VideoThe Security actions allow you to set permissions on the folders in SpringCM to control and manage access by the SpringCM users in your account.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Security is applied at the folder level in SpringCM, and is inherited by the documents within that folder. As you create and manage your folder structure in SpringCM, you will need to determine which users should have access to each folder, and what that level of access should be.How is it used?To set access rights on a folder (and thus, all documents in that folder):Select GOTO then Documents from the menu bar.Navigate to the folder for which you want to define access.Check the folder to select it.Select Manage then Security from the menu bar.Set the desired access rights for each role.If you want to add any other candidates, type the first few letters of the user or security group name in the field provided, and when the name of the user or security group appears in the drop down, click on that name or highlight and select it to add it to the candidate list.Set the desired access rights for each candidate added to the list.Click the Save button to save your changes.Eligible Candidates for Security AccessWhen apply security to a folder or document, you can specify that security based on a user role, an individual user or a group of users. Each of these eligible candidates are described below:User Roles&amp;nbsp; _ The default layout allows you to grant or revoke access based on the user role. Only four user roles are candidates__user administrator, full subscriber, limited subscriber, and guest. Super administrators have access to all documents and folders by default.Users _ If a specific user needs explicit access granted or revoked, that user can be added to the list of candidates, then assigned the desired security setting.Security Groups _ If a specific security group needs explicit access granted or revoked, that security group can be added to the list of candidates, then assigned the desired security setting.Security Access DefinitionsWhen applying security you can set the following access rights to each candidate or candidate group:No Access _ prohibits the user from accessing folders or documents. This is the default setting for all content in SpringCM.View _ permits users to view folders and documents (via preview mode or download)View &amp;amp; Create _ permits users to view the folder, upload new content and to revise the content of a document, but they cannot edit the attributes of a document.View &amp;amp; Edit _ permits users to view, revise, share and upload new content, but they are not allowed to delete either the folder or the document, nor grant access.View, Edit, &amp;amp; Delete _ permits users to view, revise, share, upload new content, and delete documents and folders, but they are not allowed to grant access.View, Edit, Delete, &amp;amp; Set Access _ permits users to grant or revoke access to folders and documents in addition to full privilege for view, edit, share, upload and delete.Security InheritanceUnless otherwise specified, documents and subfolders inherit the security settings established at the parent folder. When viewing the security settings of subfolders or documents, you will see that most, if not all, security settings are noted as (Inherited) (e.g.., Guest _ No Access (Inherited))(Inherited) indicates that the No Access security setting for the Guest role is inherited from the parent folder. Settings not noted as (Inherited) mean that the setting has been explicitly set at the subfolder or document level.Use Explicit settings for specific subfolders that require different security settings than those established in the parent folder.View Permissions for All usersClick the View Permissions for All Users check box to see all the users who have access to a specific folder or document. This feature functions as a convenient way to double check who will be able to see the folder, and that all the appropriate users have the proper security settings.Determining a User's Security SettingsSecurity settings can be established using different group, role and user settings. Use the following to determine the order of precedence for interpreting a user's access rights.Check to see if the user is a Super Administrator. Super administrators have access to all folders and documents, thus need no explicit or effective security settings. If the user is NOT a super administrator, proceed to the next step.Check to see if the user has explicit settings. If yes, the user's security settings have been established at this level. If the user does NOT have explicit settings at this level, proceed to the next step.Check to see if the user is a member of a security group with explicit settings. If yes, the user's security settings have been established at this level. If the user does NOT have explicit security group settings at this level, proceed to the next step.Check to see if the user is a member of multiple security groups with explicit settings. If yes, the least restrictive group (i.e.. _ the one that provides access to the most folders and documents) takes precedent. If the user is NOT a member of multiple explicit security groups at this level, proceed to the next step.Check to see if the user's user role includes explicit settings. If the user's user role includes specific security settings, the user's security settings have been established at this level. If the user's user role does NOT contain explicit security group settings at this level, proceed to the next step.Move up one folder level and perform steps Steps 2_5. Continue moving up one folder level if none of these steps reveal a user's security settings.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create an explicit scheduleTo create a recurring scheduleTo manage schedulesWhat is it?A Schedule is simply a specific date and time definition or a recurring day and time definition that is stored for use by other SpringCM features such as rules or reports. It is similar in concept to defining an individual or recurring meeting on your calendar, except that it is stored for general use.There are two kinds of schedules that can be created:Explicit _ Allows you to specify a specific date and time.Recurring _ Allows you to specify a day and time relative to the Hour, Week, or MonthWhen is it used?Create a schedule when you want to establish a explicit date and time or a recurring day and time for a Smart Rule to reference so as to define when that rule will be run. In turn, the scheduled Smart Rule can execute a variety of actions that will occur at the scheduled time. These actions include:Send an EmailStart a WorkflowSend a Custom ReportMove Document(s) to TrashHow is it used?To create a explicit scheduleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Schedules from the Account Preferences treeSelect Schedule then New from the menu barEnter a descriptive Name for the schedule. A descriptive name will help you choose from among options when using a schedule selection drop down. (required)Enter a Description for the schedule (optional).Enter a date when in the Effective Between From date field in the format MM/DD/YYYY. If a To date is specified, it will be removed since you are not configuring a recurring schedule.Enter an Execution Time in the format HH:MM:SS ?M where ?M is either AM or PM. Please note that you will need to adjust the time so that it is entered in Central Standard Time (i.e., the time will not automatically adjust for your time zone or daylight savings time)Click SaveExpected Results: The schedule will be saved and added to a list of schedules so it ready for selection by scheduled Smart Rules. The Smart Rule that runs on this schedule will execute at the specified time for the date specified. After the Smart Rule runs, it will be automatically disabled because there is no future scheduled date.To create a recurring scheduleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Schedules from the Account Preferences treeSelect Schedule then New from the menu barEnter a descriptive Name for the schedule. A descriptive name will help you choose from among options when using a schedule selection drop down. (required)Enter a Description for the schedule (optional).Enter a date range in the Effective Between date fields in the format MM/DD/YYYY. This will represent the dates during which the schedule will be valid.Enter an Execution Time in the format HH:MM ?M where ?M is either AM or PM. Please note that you will need to adjust the time so that it is entered in Central Standard Time (i.e., the time will not automatically adjust for your time zone or daylight savings time)Expanding the section titled RecurrenceChoose the radio button for Hourly, Weekly, or Monthly then provide the additional information required for each option as noted below:Hourly _ Use this option if you want to run a Smart Rule more than one time a day on&amp;nbsp; particular days of the week. You will need to provide the interval in hours (e.g., every 1 hour, every 2 hours, etc.) and also specify the days of the week when it will be run. The initial time will be taken from the Execution time field then it will execute every two hours after that. The schedule will only be valid within the dates configured in the Effective Between fields.Weekly _ Use this option if you want to run a Smart Rule at the configured time on&amp;nbsp; particular days of the week (rather than every day). You will need to specify the days of the week when it will be run. The time will be taken from the Execution time field, and the schedule will only be valid within the dates configured in the Effective Between fields.Monthly _ Use this option if you want to run a Smart Rule at the configured time on particular days of the month (rather than every day). You will need to choose to either specify specific days of the month or use relative days of the month. If you select specific days using the Days of Month radio button option , enter one or more numbers representing the DD value that you would find in a typical MM/DD/YYYY format (i.e., 01, 15). If you select relative days, the Day of Week radio button option, first select the relative option from the drop down (i.e., First, Second, Last, Second to Last) and then the day of the week from the day drop down. The time will be taken from the Execution time field, and the schedule will only be valid within the dates configured in the Effective Between fields.Click SaveExpected Results: The schedule will be saved and added to a list of schedules so it ready for selection by scheduled Smart Rules. Use the descriptions accompanying the recurrence options above for details on when to expect the schedule to run. After the Smart Rule runs, if it determines that there is no valid future date based on the configured schedule and the effective dates, it will be automatically disabled.To manage schedulesSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Schedules from the Account Preferences treeCheck the schedule that you want to manage from the list of defined schedulesSelect Schedule then select either Edit or Delete from the menu bar to change or eliminate the checked schedule(s).Note: Before deleting a schedule, visit your Smart Rules to ensure that the schedule is not in use, and if it is, change the Smart Rule to point to a different schedule.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Business Sync Conflicts can occur in a variety of scenarios: when a document is named incorrectly, when you don't have the ability to edit a document, when the path to the document is too long for the operating system to support, and when a newer version of the document exists that you have just edited to name a few. Sync triggers these conflicts so that you can resolve the issue and synchronize your content as soon as the conflict is resolved.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;The Conflict Resolution Wizard is triggered any time a conflict is detected. When a conflict occurs, the Conflict Resolution Wizard will pop up, requiring intervention. &amp;nbsp;In the event of a conflict, you will have the flexibility to rename, ignore, revert or undo any changes before they are synced. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How is it used?How to resolve a SpringCM Business Sync conflictSpringCM Sync will check for changes and when it detects that the subscribed folder has changed, it will trigger a conflict. &amp;nbsp;For a list of all potential conflicts and their recommended resolution, please visit the&amp;nbsp;Business Sync Conflict Resolution and Subscription Limits article. &amp;nbsp;In general, when the Conflict Resolution Wizard opens on your desktop, perform the following steps:Review the conflict&amp;nbsp;that has occurred. &amp;nbsp;At the top of the Wizard there will be a description as to why the conflict occurredReview potential causes and check for key information such as:Folder Name&amp;nbsp;Document nameWhen it was createdWhen it was modifiedWho last modified it?Review&amp;nbsp;resolution&amp;nbsp;options availableChoose resolutionClick&amp;nbsp;OK&amp;nbsp;to exit Conflict Resolution pop_up</content:encoded>

        <title>SFTP</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/sftp</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?What client to use?How is it used?Limitations&amp;nbsp;What is it?FTP, or file transfer protocol, is a method of moving sets of documents or folders from your hard drive to SpringCM and vice_versa.&amp;nbsp; SpringCM's Secure FTP access (SFTP) allows you to access files on your server similarly to how you would navigate through the files on your local computer.&amp;nbsp; SFTP is similar to FTP.&amp;nbsp; SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol and is the encrypted version of FTP so it is more secure and reliable than FTP.&amp;nbsp; For this reason, SpringCM supports SFTP.&amp;nbsp; FTP is not supported.&amp;nbsp;There are many SFTP software external to SpringCM that can be used.&amp;nbsp; If you have never used SFTP to transfer files before, please make sure you research how to do this from the software's instruction manuals or website.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?SFTP&amp;nbsp;can be used for all your uploading and downloading needs within SpringCM or to move documents across different folders.&amp;nbsp; It most often is used for larger document and folder migrations _ both TO SpringCM, and FROM SpringCM.&amp;nbsp; This approach should be used to move batches of files 30MB or greater (total batch size) up to about 1GB.Folder structure hierarchy is maintained when using SFTP, so if you are moving a folder hierarchy, (i.e. parent folder with children sub_folders), your folder structure will be kept intact through the move.&amp;nbsp; Another great advantage to using SFTP is that most software offers the ability to see the status of each document so you know which documents have been successfully moved and which ones may have failed.&amp;nbsp;SFTP should NOT be used to delete files or folders.&amp;nbsp; When deleting through SFTP, please know that files will automatically be disassociated from the folder in the process (this is a feature of SFTP clients, not SpringCM).&amp;nbsp; If you delete a folder with many files for example, you will see the folder separately from the files in trash folder.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What client to use?To use SFTP, you will need to download and install a software to your machine to manage the protocol(s).&amp;nbsp; SFTP software is referred to as an SFTP Client.&amp;nbsp; While any SFTP client should work, SpringCM recommends use of a freeware called Filezilla.&amp;nbsp;There are known issues with WinSCP's SFTP client, specifically the resumable file upload feature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This feature should not be used and SpringCM is not responsible for issues that may occur when uploading files with this feature enabled.How is it used?Once you have installed a SFTP client, you can connect to SpringCM by taking the following steps:Open your preferred SFTP client program.You will enter SpringCM's SFTP URL in the address field.&amp;nbsp; Based on the data center you are working from, the URL will vary.&amp;nbsp; For example, the Address for our NA11 data center will be &quot;sftp://sftpna11.springcm.com&quot;.&amp;nbsp; You can confirm and copy the SFTP URL by navigating in the platform to the HELP menu __&amp;gt; SpringCM Resources selection.&amp;nbsp; The SFTP URL for your account will be displayed there.&amp;nbsp;Enter &quot;22&quot; to the Port field.&amp;nbsp;Enter your SpringCM username and password when prompted for your username and password.Once you are connected, you will see two panels _ one, on the left, which will show you your local folders/directory.&amp;nbsp; On the right, a panel showing all folders for each SpringCM account in which you are a member.&amp;nbsp; No documents can be placed in the root of this directory.&amp;nbsp; You should navigate to the desired folder within a specific account you would like to drop documents into and begin uploading or downloading.&amp;nbsp; Making a simple drag_and_drop action of the folders or documents from one panel to the other will copy the files from one location to the other (whether local __&amp;gt; SpringCM, or SpringCM __&amp;gt; local).LimitationsMS Office Naming Convention/Folder Structure LimitationsMicrosoft Office limits the number of characters you can use in the folder path and file names when you transfer documents. If your MS Office documents are stored in a complex folder structure that comprises many characters, you may have difficulty uploading them to SpringCM. If this problem arises, reduce the number of folders and/or truncate document naming conventions. The character length limits vary for each MS Office application as follows:Microsoft Word _ 254 characters including the file name extension.Microsoft PowerPoint _ 258 characters including the file name extension.Microsoft Access _ 258 characters including the file name extension.Microsoft Outlook _ 258 characters including the file name extension.Microsoft Excel _ 218 characters including the file name extension.SFTP Firewall RestrictionsThe tradeoff to being a secure form of transfer is that there may be potential run_ins with firewalls.&amp;nbsp; You may need to reconfigure several firewalls to allow SFTP to work.&amp;nbsp; Please work with your IT department to overcome this obstacle if needed.&amp;nbsp;Date and Time StampsDepending on the FTP client used, the date and time stamps displayed in that client for folders and documents may differ from the actual SpringCM system date and time stamp.&amp;nbsp; This is a known issue which is outside of SpringCM control and unique to the FTP client being leveraged.&amp;nbsp; To confirm the actual modification dates and times on your documents or folders, please view those details in SpringCM (web UI).&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To provision a fax number for inbound faxingTo decommission a fax numberTo send a document as an outbound faxWhat is it?SpringCM is capable of receiving faxes and uploading them into a folder associated with a specific fax number. You can also distribute your SpringCM documents via fax.When is it used?Faxing features work well when the sender or the recipient is not a user within your SpringCM account because it allows them to add content and view documents without logging in. It is also typically used when the sender or recipient does not have ready or reliable internet access, yet they need a way to upload content to or receive content from SpringCM.How is it used?To provision a fax number for inbound faxingInbound faxes will be automatically uploaded to a SpringCM folder by associating a fax number with that folder. You must be a SpringCM Super Administrator to provision a fax number for a folder. There is a monthly charge for each fax number that will be applied to your SpringCM account. Your SpringCM Account Representative can help you determine the cost.Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Manage Fax Lines. Any fax numbers which have already been provisioned for your account will be displayed.Select Fax then Provision Number from the menu bar if you need a new fax number. If there is already an existing fax number that you want to use, skip to step 5.You will be prompted with a notice about the monthly charge. Click Accept to acknowledge the monthly charge.Check the fax number that you want to configure. If you created a new fax number in step 3, this will be the fax number that was just provisioned for you.Select Folder then Assign Folder from the menu barUse the Select Items dialog to navigate to the folder to which faxes will be delivered, then click Select to select the folder and close the dialog.Expected Results: The selected folder will be associated with the newly provisioned fax number. Any fax that is received to that fax number will be saved as a TIFF image in the designated folder.To decommission a fax numberSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Manage Fax Lines. Any fax numbers which have already been provisioned for your account will be displayed.Check the fax number that you want to decommissionSelect Folder then Unassign Folder from the menu barClick Accept to confirm the unassignCheck the fax number that you want to decommission a second timeSelect Fax then Release Number from the menu barClick Accept to confirm the releaseExpected Results: Unassign Folder is used to dissociate a fax line with a specific folder but it will leave the fax number available for use within your account, and it can be reassigned to a different folder if you like. Release Number will remove the fax number from your account. If you choose to release a fax number, the fax number is no longer available in your account and cannot be recovered. Use Release Number when you no longer need the number provisioned to your account.To send a document as an outbound faxIf a user or a contact in your Address Book contains a fax number, you can use SpringCM's outbound fax capability to send a fax of a document.Navigate to a folder and check one or more document that you want to send. You can also start with a list of documents found via a search.Select Send then Fax from the menu bar.Begin typing the user name in the recipient field, and it will attempt to autocomplete the name based on the contents of the Address Book.Customize the Fax cover page using the Subject and&amp;nbsp;Message fields.If you need to attach additional documents, click the Select Items option and choose an additional document.Click SendExpected Results: The selected documents will be faxed to the recipient's fax number that is configured in the Address Book, along with a cover page containing the subject and message. See the knowledge article titled Send Documents for a comparison of outbound faxing with other send options.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?SpringCM Sync is the first and only application designed for business users who synchronize content with the SpringCM cloud platform. The Administator must enable folder sync in order for business users to be able to take advantage of SpringCMs syncing capabilities.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?SpringCM Sync can be used to easily sync documents from the business users computer to SpringCM to the rest of your team via sync capabilities. Syncing documents to the computer allows access to the documents and folders that the end user is actively working on. In order for end users to be able to use Sync, the&amp;nbsp;Account Administrator will need to enable folder sync and set the account up.&amp;nbsp;How is it used? An administrator will need to enable Sync to run in a SpringCM environment.&amp;nbsp;Steps to configure sync preferences for the AccountAs the Administrator, log into SpringCM.Select PreferencesSelect Sync Preferences: GeneralSet Enable folder sync to Yes. &amp;nbsp;This will enable users to Sync from SpringCM. If this is not turned on, then end users will see the following message when they try and select folders to synchronize.Enable&amp;nbsp;Age Filtering&amp;nbsp;to control how much content is stored on the end users desktop. As an administrator, you may have multiple concerns: limiting the number of company assets (documents) that are stored on workstations and how much storage space is being consumed on workstations. To mitigate these concerns, you can set an age filter that limits documents that are synchronized to only those that have been added or changed recently. If an age filter is not set, then all documents that are in sync folders will be synchronized. If an age filter is set to 30 days then only documents that have been added or changed within the last 30 days. &amp;nbsp;Anything that has not been edited within the past 30 days will not be synchronized. &amp;nbsp;Perform the following steps to configure and setup age filtering:Set Enable document age filter for sync to YesSet Do not sync files with edit dates older than days to a valid number of days.&amp;nbsp;If your SpringCM license allows the Administrator to define a set of rules to automatically synchronize content, then optionally set an age&amp;nbsp;Review the number of documents that your license allows you to Sync. If your company needs to synchronize more documents, then contact your sales rep or SpringCM as to how this number can be increased.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Forms</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/forms</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?Forms enable you to replace paper processes with Web_based forms.&amp;nbsp; Attribute fields can be mapped to Forms fields.&amp;nbsp; User or super administrators can create Forms and make them public (available to anyone with Internet access) or private (available only to fellow SpringCM users). You can store submitted Forms in a folder or place them in an Advanced Workflow step. Users can update submitted Forms if they have the proper security settings on the appropriate folder.All Forms are written in HTML, the same computer language used for forms on most commercial Web sites. You can include fields from your attributes groups in an eForm. Selecting attributes serves as a wizard that will automatically generate the HTML code for your eForm. Once the HTML code is generated, you can easily modify it within the New Form HTML box or by copying and pasting the HTML code into an HTML editor, modifying the HTML code within that HTML editor, and pasting the updated code into the New Form HTML box. You can also write HTML code and paste it into the New Form HTML box without using any attributes.When is it used?Forms are used to replace paper forms.&amp;nbsp; The key advantage of Forms is that attribute fields can be embedded in the eForm itself so there is no need to tag that information to a document.&amp;nbsp; Document and attributes are merged together.&amp;nbsp; Forms are commonly used to initiate Workflows and Smart Rules.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?To set up an eForm:Click the Forms tab.Click the Create button in the toolbar, or, from the menu bar,&amp;nbsp;select Form __&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Create.To select an attribute field you'd like to use in the eForm, make sure Show Attribute Groups checkbox is selected.&amp;nbsp; This will display any Attribute Groups that exist in the account.Click the&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;sign&amp;nbsp;next to the appropriate attributes group and select the desired attribute field(s).Repeat Step 4 as many times as needed.Note: To include all attribute fields in an attribute group, click the Attribute Fields check box.After selecting the appropriate attribute fields, click the Generate Sample Form button and SpringCM will create the HTML code for your form in the Form HTML box.To add additional attribute fields, you can select the check box next to each field name and click the Append Selected Fields button.&amp;nbsp; This will place the new field at the bottom of the existing HTML code.If you would like to have attachments submitted with the eForm, you can select the Append Attachhment Control button.To check the eForm, click Preview.After making any necessary modifications, change the defaul&amp;nbsp;New Form value in the Name field.Click Save.Complete the Submit eForm to a Specific Folder steps.</content:encoded>

When the folder is selected for the rule, any documents and subfolders found in that Folder are not synchronizable. Documents &amp;nbsp;the criteria specified in the rule will not be synchronized to the desktop even if the folder is a subscribed folder. Examples include the following:the Finance Folderthe Human Resource Folderthe Management Documents FolderIf the Administrator has set up these rules, then these folders are not selectable for synchronization in the Sync client.When is it used?&amp;nbsp;When the Administrator, in working with the business, has determined how to restrict content from being synchronized by generating a set of rules.

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to revoke a device?ConsiderationsRequirements&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;The SpringCM applications for Sync, Edit, Scan, and Mobile apps download documents onto these devices.&amp;nbsp; Administrators need to be able to both remotely wipe devices and to deny users access to use particular applications on particular devices. &amp;nbsp;Consistent with the rest of SpringCM, an administrator is only able to control the users access to documents in the account which the administrator is controlling.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;When the Administrator, in working with the business, has identified a set of users who should be restricted from using an App or Apps. It can be used when:a device has been lost and content needs to be wipeda user has left the company&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How to revoke an app on a deviceLogin to SpringCM as the Account AdministratorSelect PreferencesSelect Account Preferences: Device ManagementEnter the email address of the user whose devices you want to see.&amp;nbsp;Select the UserSelect the Select buttonUpon completing this task, you will see all devices that have SpringCM apps installed that support the Device Management process. Details provided will include:All of the devices registeredFor Each deviceThe Device ID is a unique ID that defines the device. &amp;nbsp;The app grabs the device id and passes it back to SpringCN.The Device Name is a user friendly name. The Device Name typically defaults the name registered with the OS; however, the user can change the name as they see fit.Each SpringCM App that is installed on the Device.The current status of each AppActive: The app is active and communicate with SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;Revoke Requested: The Administrator has initiated a revoke request for the App.Revoked: The App has received the revoke request and has completed the data wipe and logged the user out of the Application. The App checks periodically for a revoke request and upon receipt, will delete any local data including documents and log the user out of the application. When this request has been completed, the app will communicate back to SpringCM that this action has been completed. If the user tries to authorize again, then the app will communicate the revoked status.&amp;nbsp;Activity: Activity is currently limited to the Sync app and displays the last time a sync request was made and what folders are being synchronized.&amp;nbsp;The Administrator can perform the following tasksRevoke a specific device: If a device is revoked, then all apps will be revoked.Revoke a specific app: If an app is revoked, then only that app will be revokedRevoke all devices: If all devices are revoked, then every app on every device will be revoked.Activate an app, device, or all devices.&amp;nbsp;ConsiderationsThe Revoke Request will be processed by the application silently. When it is received, it will automatically delete all local content and log the user out of the application.If an app on a device is revoked and the user tries to reauthorize, then the app will indicate that the user has been revoked for that device.&amp;nbsp;Activity only applies to Sync currently.

        <title>Delete Action (Documents or Folders) and Emptying the Trash</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/delete_document_trash</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?How to delete a file or folder (for users with delete access to the specific file or folder)How to Empty TrashHow to restore TrashHow to specify the Trash Retention Days (Super Administrator function)&amp;nbsp;What is it?The Delete feature, located in the Documents workspace, enables those with delete rights on a folder to delete documents with that folder, or to delete the folder itself.&amp;nbsp; Delete privileges are granted by default to super administrators.&amp;nbsp; Full Subscribers or User Administrators can be granted delete rights to folders. When a document is deleted, it will be stored in Trash folder until the defined Trash Retention Period expires (this is defined in the Preferences _ Account Preferences _ General).&amp;nbsp; The defaul retention period is 90 days from the date of deletion. Once files are deleted from the trash folder, they are permanently deleted and cannot be retrieved by SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Documents and folders in the trash are displayed with strikethrough in the name to make it more obvious when accessing a document in the trash bin.&amp;nbsp; Super Administrators can also take the action to Empty Trash at empty time _ which will permanently delete all documents and folders in the Trash. When is it used?Files and folders are deleted when the document or folder is out of date or no longer relevant.&amp;nbsp; When files are deleted, they move to a Trash folder, which works a lot like a Recycle Bin in Windows or Mac.&amp;nbsp; Deleted items are stored until a designated time is met or until the file is explicitly deleted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How is it used?How to delete a document or folder (for users with delete access to the specific file or folder)Click the Documents tab.Select the documents or folders to delete.Open the File menu and choose the Delete feature.Click the OK button to confirm delete request. &amp;nbsp;(Note: Read the warning message closely. Once you click Ok, items&amp;nbsp;cannot&amp;nbsp;be restored.)&amp;nbsp;How to Empty Trash (Super Administrator Function)Trash will automatically and irrevocably be emptied once the Trash Retention Days expires (90 days by default from the date of deletion). As items are deleted, the items are placed in a &quot;day&quot; folder for all content deleted on that day (&quot;20150812&quot; for example). To manually Empty Trash (permanently deleting all content within the Trash):Navigate to the Documents tab.&amp;nbsp; From the File menu, click Empty TrashType in the word Delete to confirm the empty trash can requestClick the&amp;nbsp;OK&amp;nbsp;button to confirm delete request. &amp;nbsp;(Note: Read the warning message closely. Once you click Ok, items&amp;nbsp;cannot&amp;nbsp;be restored.)&amp;nbsp;How to restore Trash&amp;nbsp;(Super Administrator Function)Folders and Files that have been moved out of the trash and restored to the working folder structure until they are permanently deleted. Moving a folder or document out of the Trash folder is a manual process to pick up the document(s) or folders(s) and move them back to the folder tree. To take items out of the Trash folders:Navigate to the Trash folder.Click on the folder of the date the document(s) or folder(s) were deleted &quot;(20150812&quot;).Select the Folder(s) and/or File(s)Drag and Drop or Cut and Paste the items to the destination folder&amp;nbsp;How to specify the Trash Retention Days (Super Administrator function)By default, deleted items remain in Trash for 90 days after which they are irrevocably delete and cannot be &amp;nbsp;restored. The number of days that items remain in Trash is configurable. To modify the Empty Trash schedule:From the Go To menu bar, select Preferences.Under Account Preferences, select General.Under the General section, type in the number of days to store items in the trash folder under Trash Retention Days:Click the 'Save' button.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?Custom Reporting enables you to create tailored reports designed to monitor your business activity and identify areas for improvement. Gain insight into your business by making use of the raw data stored in your account. Super administrators can create a Custom Report and then provide access to the appropriate users like process managers or executives who can easily run the Custom Report.When is it used?SpringCM provides default standard reports to our customers to answer common business questions.&amp;nbsp; If the information you are seeking is not in one of our predefined reports, a customized report can be created to suit your business need.&amp;nbsp; It is possible to report off of document, attribute, workflow, case outbound delivery and folder information.&amp;nbsp; New reports can only be created by super administrators but can be published to users with other user roles in SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How is it used?The Report Wizard should be used to create custom reports.&amp;nbsp; The Report Wizard contains three primary steps _ Data Selection, Column Selection and Criteria Selection.1. Data SelectionThe Data Selection step enables you to select the type of data you will use in your report. You can choose from&amp;nbsp;eight types: Document, Documents and Folders, Documents and Attributes,&amp;nbsp;Workflow Steps, Workflows Initiated, Document History, and Documents, Folders, and Attributes.Enter the Name of the report in the Name field.Identify the minimum User Role who can view the report.&amp;nbsp;Add one item to report on: Documents, Attributes or Documents, Folders, and Attributes.&amp;nbsp; If attributes are selected, use the Attribute Group selector to add one or more Attribute Groups&amp;nbsp;to report on.Click Next to proceed to Column Selection.2. Column SelectionSelect the&amp;nbsp;column headers that will appear&amp;nbsp;in your report in this step from the Available column options.&amp;nbsp; Attribute fields are displayed with the name of its attribute group.Use the arrows to select available data types named in the Data Selection step.Use the First, Up, Down, and Last buttons to place column headers in the desired order.Specify column names and width if desired.Click Next to proceed to Criteria Selection or Previous to return to Data Selection.3. Criteria SelectionSelect Report Parameters, Filters, and a Default Sort Column in this step.&amp;nbsp; Parameters are filters that the end user can define.&amp;nbsp; Filters are automatically taken into consideration while generating the report and cannot be modified.Test the workflow using the Preview button, and&amp;nbsp;click the Save button when the report ready for users to run.Date Filters must follow a specific naming convention: [+_]{0,1}[0_9]+[dmy] where d=day, m=month and y=year.&amp;nbsp; If you want to report on the current date, put '0d' in the Value or Default Value field.&amp;nbsp; If you are looking for a report for the last thirty days, you can specify '_30d'&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Creating and Managing Attribute Groups</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/creating_and_managing_attribute_groups</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create an attribute group To define a repeatable attributeTo define an attribute setTo define a name templateTo define a custom validation string for an attributeTo relate attributes groups To modify an attributes groupTo delete an attribute groupAttribute Type Definitions Attribute Field Control Options Additional ResourcesWhat is it?A SpringCM Attribute Group contains a set of attributes or metadata that can be applied, either automatically or manually, to a SpringCM document.&amp;nbsp; Attribute Groups are used to track information about the document that is not tracked by default in the SpringCM document properties (e.g., size, create date, last modified date).&amp;nbsp;Attributes groups provide a way to classify content by adding specific values to documents that can facilitate searching and ensure quick retrieval. In a similar manner, they can be used for reporting on content and creating dashboards. Attributes can also be used to trigger rules and workflows. Well defined Attribute Groups will establish consistency for data entry standards, which in turn can help for managing compliance. Attributes groups do not modify documents; they simply add metadata to your documents.When is it used?Define one or more Attribute Group whenever you have the need to classify your documents so as to facilitate searching and reporting, or for triggering workflows.For example, if you want to find invoices by vendor, date, purchase order number, or amount, create an Attribute Group called Invoices. Create attributes in the group to store Vendor, Date, PO Number and the amount. Once the attribute group is applied to the document, the document attributes can be filled in with values. Searches for documents can be conducted looking for documents that match specific values.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?An Attribute Group is a collection of attributes. Attributes come in different varieties, and these different attributes can be used in a variety of ways to facilitate the enter of the values into the attribute. When you are creating an attribute group, you will need to define these attributes and configure each according to the type of attribute. The sections below describe the basics of creating a group, then provides information on some of the specific attribute type settings.To create an attribute groupSelect GOTO then Preferences on the menu barSelect Attributes within the Account Preferences treeSelect Group then Create Group from the menu bar OR click the Create Group button on the toolbar.Enter a Name for the Attribute Group (required). It is considered best practice to make the name as descriptive as possible as it relates to the purpose of the attributes within the group.Type in the name of your first attribute in the New Field box. Make the name descriptive of what you expect the user to enter since this will serve as a label for the attribute.Use the Select Type dropdown to choose a type for the attribute. Refer to the section below titled Attribute Type Definitions for additional information.Check each of the attribute control options that you want to apply to this attribute from among Required, Read_only, Repeatable, etc. See the section below titled Attribute Field Control Options for additional informationIf your attribute group will contain more fields, click the +FIELD button to add a another field, and repeat steps 5 through 8 until all attributes have been defined.Click Save to complete the operation.To define a repeatable attributeA repeatable attribute means that multiple values may be entered for the attribute for a single document. For example, for a single resume the human resources administrator who reviews the resume may want to specify specific skills from a set of pre_defined skills which can be used for searching at a later date. Using a single Hiring attribute group and a single Attribute of Skill, the multiple skills observed upon review the resume can be entered by simply adding an additional occurrence of the repeatable attribute Skill.Select GOTO then Preferences on the menu barSelect Attributes within the Account Preferences treeClick on the Attribute Group you want to modifyCheck Repeatable on the attribute field for which you want to be able to enter multiple values.&amp;nbsp;Expected Results: For any field that is marked as repeatable, the user will be presented with an option to Add Field in the navigation panel in Document Preview for documents associated with that attribute group.To define an attribute setAn Attribute Set is a set of attributes within the attribute group that are grouped together so that they act like a single logical data point. For example, the attribute Invoice Number and Invoice Date may be grouped into a set because together they create a logical data point which identifies the invoice.&amp;nbsp;Attributes Sets are often also marked with the Repeatable option, which allow for more than one occurrence of the attribute set. Using the example above, if our Invoice Number and Invoice Date attribute set was configured as Repeatable, then more than one Invoice could be entered for the document.To designate any attribute field as repeatable, simply click the Repeatable checkbox to the right of the field nameBegin to define your attribute group as noted above until you get to your field definition.When you are ready to create the attribute set, click the +Set buttonType in a Name for your attribute set. The name will display in Document Preview, providing the ability to collapse and expand the set to hide and display the attributes respectively.Define a Name Template if you wish. See the section below on Name Templates for more details.Check the Repeatable option if you want the attribute set to be able to be entered more than one time.Type in the name of your first attribute in the New Field box. Make the name descriptive of what you expect the user to enter since this will serve as a label for the attribute.Use the Select Type dropdown to choose a type for the attribute. Refer to the section below titled Attribute Type Definitions for additional information.Check each of the attribute control options that you want to apply to this attribute from among Required, Read_only, Repeatable, etc. See the section below titled Attribute Field Control Options for additional informationClick the +FIELD button to add a another field to the set, and repeat steps 5 through 8 until all attributes have been defined for the attribute set.Continue to define other fields (not part of the set) if desired.Click Save to finish defining the attribute group.Expected Results: The attribute set will appear as a collapsible section within the attribute group section in the navigation panel in Document Preview for documents associated with that attribute group. If the set is marked as repeatable, the user will be presented with an option to Add Set to add another occurrence of the set.&amp;nbsp;To define a name templateA Name Template will allow you to enforce standard document name formats on documents using names that are dynamically derived from attribute values. That is, documents can be automatically named based upon any attribute fields in an assigned attribute group.For example, if the document is assigned an attribute group called Invoices, with attributes Invoice Number, Invoice Date and Vendor, then the document name can be derived from these attributes and assigned to the document such that it would contain static text and dynamic text. For example, the document could be named something like Invoice No. 12345 for vendor name dated 10_12_2014.doc.Note: Enabling a name template in an existing attributes group will update the document name for any document associated with that attribute group. It is considered best practice not to modify an existing attribute group with a name template, but rather to create a new attribute group before defining the name template.Select GOTO then Preferences on the menu barSelect Attributes within the Account Preferences treeClick on the Attribute Group you want to modifyEnter the naming format in Name Template field using the following guidelines_ Type static text to be applied to the name without any additional punctuation_ Include dynamic attribute field text by placing the attribute name within two sets of square bracketsClick the Save button to save the name template.To define a custom validation string for an attributeCustom validation strings are regular expressions that are checked against values entered into an attribute field after the default attribute entry type has already been checked. Attribute values are only considered valid once both of these checks have been passed.&amp;nbsp;When defining a custom validation string, the administrator can optionally specify a custom error message which will be displayed if the custom validation string does not pass. Custom error messages will display in place of the default error message whenever a user attempts to enter a value into the attribute field that is not valid.If a custom validation string is applied or changed after values have already been saved for this attribute field, only newly entered values will have the updated validation checked against them.Although these two features have been grouped together in the user interface, they do not depend on one another.&amp;nbsp; A custom error message will be fully functional without a custom validation string and a custom validation string will simply display a default error message if a custom error message is not specified.To specify a custom validation string and/or custom error message:Select GOTO then Preferences on the menu barSelect Attributes within the Account Preferences treeClick on the Attribute Group you want to modifyClick Customize on the attribute field to which you want to apply the custom setting. This will expose to extra fields: Custom Error Message and Validation Regular Expression.If you desire a custom validation string, enter a regular expression in the field Validation Regular Expression. A regular expression is a standard ASP.NET programming construct which is used to validate text fields. It is a structured string which defines the allowable characters and the layout of the string. For example, enter the string ^\d{3}_\d{2}_\d{4}$ to validate a Social Security Number attribute field to the format ###_##_####Additional examples and details on using regular expressions can be found in the article How To: Use Regular Expressions to Constrain Input in ASP.NETIf you desire to specify a custom error message, enter that custom message in the field Custom Error Message. You can specify a custom error message for any field, even if you are not using a custom validation string. It is considered best practice to use a custom error message if you are using a custom validation string, but it is not required.To relate attributes groupsRelating Attributes Groups enables you to create dynamic sets of related documents. When the groups are related, you can find related documents which share the same attribute group and attribute value.For example, mortgage applications often require other document types like application forms or tax returns. The mortgage applications, application forms, and tax returns are grouped by common attributes such as the applicants name or Social Security number.By relating attributes groups, you can locate related documents by simply clicking the Related Documents button in Document Preview mode.Select GOTO then Preferences on the menu barSelect Attributes within the Account Preferences treeClick on the Attribute Group you want to relateClick the Relate option next to the attribute field that is shared with another Attribute Group.Select the attribute group(s) that share(s) the corresponding fieldClick the Save button.Reciprocation between Related Attributes Groups: Attribute Group relationships are one_way relationships allowing you to find related documents only in one direction. If you want to be able to relate documents in two directions, you must establish a two_way relationship by setting a reciprocal relationship. That is setup a relationship first from Attribute Group A to Attribute Group B based on a common attribute field. Then setup a relationship from Attribute Group B to Attribute Group A based on that same common attribute field.To modify an attribute groupRename a field: To rename an attribute field within an attribute group, place your cursor in the appropriate text field, click once, and enter the desired name.Insert a New Field: To insert a new attribute field into an attribute group, click the +FIELD button to add the new field and complete the configuration, then move the field using the Up and Down arrows to position the field as desired.Delete a Field: To delete an attribute field from an attribute group, click the red X next to the attribute field name. Any data that has been previously entered into that attribute field for documents associated with the attribute group will be lost and cannot be recovered. If the field is in use, you will be prompted to confirm the delete.Modify an Attributes Data Type: The data type of an attribute field cannot be changed once the attribute group has been saved, assigned to documents, and has data.Reorder Attribute Fields: The order of the attribute fields within an attribute group will determine the top_down order that they will be displayed on the navigation pane in Document Preview. You can change the order by moving an attribute field within an attribute group. Simply click the Up or Down arrow next to the attribute field to position the field as desired.Reorder an Attribute Group: The attribute group order will determine placement of the attribute group sections within the navigation pane in Document Preview. You can change the order from the attribute group listing (Select Attributes within the Account Preferences), then select Reorder and Move Up or Move Down from the menu bar.To delete an attribute groupYour SpringCM Account Super Administrator can delete Attributes Groups that are in use on documents. Deleting an Attribute Group permanently removes its values from all documents and cannot be undone.Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu bar.Select Attributes within the Account Preferences treeClick on the Attribute Group you want to deleteSelect Group then Delete from the menu barClick OK to confirm the deleteIf the deleted group is in use, you will be prompted to confirm. Check the box&amp;nbsp;next to the words,&amp;nbsp;&quot;Permanently delete the above groups, their data and relationships.&quot;Attribute Type DefinitionsTypeDefinitionStringA sequence of alphanumeric characters such as a letter of the alphabet, a digit, a blank space, a punctuation mark, etc.The string will typically represent words and text.NumberAn integer or whole number from _2,147,483,648 through+2,147,483,647.DateA date formatted field in the format MM/DD/YYYY. The field will automatically include a calendar selector toolDrop DownA validated field where contents are validated against a list of valid string values.DecimalA real or floating point number.

Used to provide a unique identifier for the document.&amp;nbsp;Attribute Field Control OptionsOptionDefinitionRequiredThe attribute must be populated when an attribute group is applied to a document and saved.Read OnlyThe user cannot add or modify the attribute value. This type of attribute is typically populated by backend processes such as workflows and folder defaults.RepeatableMultiple values may be provided for the same attribute.CustomizeThe value will be formatted based on an expression to ensure standard entry (i.e., Social Security number, area codes and phone numbers, etc.)RelateLinks the field to other attribute groups which have a shared field.Additional ReferencesAuto Number AttributeCascading AttributesDynamic Attribute Drop downs</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create a userTo edit a userAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?The Create and Edit User actions, located in the menu bar and on the toolbar of the Address Book, enable you to create and manage users in your SpringCM account.&amp;nbsp; A user is a person who will need to login to access SpringCM documents.&amp;nbsp; A user requires a SpringCM license in your account.&amp;nbsp; Based on their role and permissions, a user can potentially view, add, edit and share documents, as well as potentially administer the account.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?You will need to create a user when you have identified a team member, client, vendor or another individual who needs login access to SpringCM to view or work on documents in your account.How is it used?To create a userSelect GOTO then Address BookFrom the Address Book tab, click the Create User button on the toolbarChoose the User Role from the drop_down menu that should be assigned to the user.Check the option Send Activation Email if you would like the user to receive an email inviting him or her to activate the user account.Provide the users first and last names (required)Provide a valid email address for the user (required)Complete any optional fields (see Advanced Concepts below for definitions)Add any security groups that you would like the user to belong to.Click the Save button to create the user.To edit a userSelect GOTO then Address BookFilter or navigate the user/group list to find the user that you wish to changeCheck the user to select it (note: you can only edit one user at a time)Click Address Book then Edit from the menu barMake the desired modifications.Click the Save button.Advanced ConceptsUser ID (Email) Field _ this is a field that cannot be modified.&amp;nbsp; If a user is created with an incorrect email address, or the user's email changes, the user should be deleted and re_created.&amp;nbsp; We do not allow modification of the email address due to security considerations.&amp;nbsp;User Persona _ A persona can be used to change the look and feel of the SpringCM web interface based on a user's job function. See the knowledge article titled Personas for details on how to setup a user persona so it can be selected for a user in the Address Book.Billable _ Click the Billing check box to assign fiduciary responsibility. This can be used later to report on billable system activity.Enabled To/From _ Use this to define a start and end date when the user will be active in your account. For example, if you provide access to a contractor for a temporary project, you would specify the start and end dates of the project, thereby limiting the contractor to login only for the duration of the project.Security Group Membership _ It is not necessary to add the user to a security group at the time the user is created. You can create the user without adding him or her to a group, then either edit the user at a later date to add the group OR you can edit the group and add the user to the group. See the knowledge article titled Security Groups for information on how to create and modify the security group.Managed by _ Use the Managed by field to specify another SpringCM user who can manage and take action on workflow tasks that are assigned to this user. If a user is listed in the Managed by field, that user will be able to see the workflow tasks that are assigned to this user in the workflow inbox, and they can respond on behalf of the user should they be out of the office or unable to take action on their own.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Create and Edit a SpringCM Contact</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/create_and_edit_a_springcm_contact</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it Used?To create a contactTo edit a contactTo share a contactAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?The Create and Edit Contact actions, located in the menu bar and on the toolbar of the Address Book, enable you to create and manage contacts. Contacts are individuals who will not login to your SpringCM account but are included in your address book because you may want to include them as recipients on emails when sending documents from SpringCM. A contact does not require a user license.When is it used?When you send a document from within SpringCM, you can choose one or more Contacts from your Address Book who will receive the email or faxes.How is it used?To Create a ContactSelect GOTO then Address BookFrom the Address Book tab, click the Create Contact button on the toolbarCheck Shared if the contact should be visible to all SpringCM Users. Uncheck Shared if you want the contact to be Private and visible only to you.Provide the Contacts first and last names (required)If you plan to send emails to this contact via SpringCM, enter a valid email address (optional)If you plan to send faxes to this contact via SpringCM, enter a valid fax number (optional)Add any Distribution Groups that you would like the contact to belong to.Click the Save button to create the contact.Expected Results: The contact will added to your Address Book and will be available for selection in the recipient selector of the send email dialog within SpringCM.To edit&amp;nbsp; a contactSelect GOTO then Address BookFilter or navigate the user/group list to find the contact that you wish to changeCheck the contact to select it (note: you can only edit one contact at a time)Click Address Book then Edit from the menu barMake the desired modifications.Click the Save button.To share a contactSelect GOTO then Address BookFilter or navigate the user/group list to find the contact(s) that you wish to changeCheck the contact(s) you wish to share.Select Manage then Share Contacts from the menu bar.Expected Results: You will get notification that the contacts have been shared, and the contacts will be visible to all SpringCM users.Advanced ConceptsImporting Contacts _ If you have contacts stored in your preferred e_mail application (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc.), you can use the Import Contacts feature to bypass creating each contact. You will need to export a CSV file from your email application, then use that CSV file to import the contacts into SpringCM using the Import Contacts option on the menu bar.Distribution Group Membership _ It is not necessary to add the Contact to a distribution group at the time the user is created. You can create the contract without adding him or her to a group, then either edit the contact at a later date to add the group OR you can edit the group and add the contact to the group. See the knowledge article titled Distribution Groups for information on how to create and modify the distribution group.Shared vs. Private Contacts _ A Private contact is a contact that only the creator of the contact will be able to see and select when sending emails and faxes. A Shared contact will be visible to all SpringCM users and any SpringCM user will be able to send emails and faxes to this contact.</content:encoded>

It is free for all subscribers to use and easy to resolve document conflicts between SpringCM and your computer.SpringCM Business Sync Conflict Resolution guides you through when a conflict occurs between content on SpringCM and your computer.Examples:A document in SpringCM is newer than a document on your computer.A document has been added to a read_only folder on SpringCM.A document has been saved locally on your computer, but the folder inSpringCM is no longer subscribed.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?SpringCM Business Sync for Windows can be used to easily sync documents from your computer to the rest of your team. Syncing documents allows quick access to the information you care about.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?Click on the conflict you wish to resolve.Select your resolution under How to resolve this Conflict.Repeat for any other conflicts.Click&amp;nbsp;OK&amp;nbsp;to close.&amp;nbsp;Subscription Document Limit ExceededYou will be notified if you exceeded the maximum number of files that you are allowed to synchronize. You will not be allowed to sync additional documents until the issue is resolved. Deselect folders that are be synchronized. Change the age filter to reduce the number of files being synchronized. Contact your SpringCM representative to increase your subscription level.&amp;nbsp;Conflict List&amp;nbsp;ReasonPlatformDescriptionHow It Can HappenResolution OptionsNewer SpringCM VersionOSXWindowsThe document stored in SpringCM is different than the document stored locallyYou can make changes to a document while offline and save the document. When you reconnect to the internet, the changes you have made will be checked in as a new version in SpringCM.

        <description>What is it?When is it used?What can be configured for each Scanner?&amp;nbsp;</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?What can be configured for each Scanner?&amp;nbsp;What is it?The SpringCM Scan Scanner Preferences Page provides an overview of Scanners that are connected to the local computer and their configurations. &amp;nbsp;The Scanner Preference Page displays only scanners that are connected to the computer or the default scanner that has been set up in the Scan application. If a scanner is no longer connected to the computer and is not the default scanner, it will not display in the list. &amp;nbsp;If the default scanner is not connected, it will display but show as disconnected.When is it used?&amp;nbsp;The Scanner preference page is used to set the initial configuration for each scanner or in the case when a specific scanning run requires different scanning options to be set.Configured scanner settings are used everytime a scan is completed.&amp;nbsp;What can be configured for each Scanner?ADF Resolution, DPI: This represents the Automatic Document Feeder Resolution in DPI to use in completing Scans.Only supported resolutions up to 600 DPI are returned based on the specified scanner.The selected option is the one utilized in every scan. &amp;nbsp;ADF Page Size:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This represents the Automatic Document Feeder Page Size that is utilized when scanning.Use default Page Size: SpringCM Scan does not change the page size property.Use Automatic Page Size: The Scanner must support the Auto Page Size Property and in this case the application in conjunction with the Scanner detects the Page Size Automatically. If the Scanner does not support this property, it will not be detected.&amp;nbsp;Only supported Page Sizes are returned based on the specified scanner.&amp;nbsp;If the list scanner supports Page Size property a list of predefined options is added to the list. For a complete list, click the following link. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en_us/library/system.drawing.printing.paperkind.aspxFlatbed Resolution, DPI:&amp;nbsp;This represents the Flatbed Resolution in DPI to use in completing Scans.Only supported resolutions up to 600 DPI are returned based on the specified scanner.The selected option is the one utilized.&amp;nbsp;Color:&amp;nbsp;What color mode the Scanner is scanning the document inColor: Completes the Scan in Color in red, green, and blue shades.&amp;nbsp;As an intermediate step a&amp;nbsp;JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)&amp;nbsp;is created that is converted to PDFGray: Completes the Scan in Grayscale mode.&amp;nbsp;As an intermediate step a JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is created that is converted to PDFBlack and White: Completes the Scan in Black and White.&amp;nbsp;As an intermediate step a PNG (Portable Network Graphic File) is created that is converted to PDFMode:&amp;nbsp;What mode the Scanner is scanning the document inAuto: Auto mode utilizes the mode that is default for that Scanner. In this case, the app will check with the scanner&amp;nbsp;Automatic Document Feeder utilzes the Automatic Document FeederDuplex: If the Scanner supports Dupex and duplex is selected, then both front and back sides of the document will be scanned.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Collaborate with a Colleague with Sync</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/collaborate_with_a_colleague_with_sync</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to cause a conflictHow to resolve a conflict&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;Sync can be used to improve personal productivity but it can also be used in collaborating with a colleague on a project. &amp;nbsp;Colleagues can synchronize the same folder and work on the same documents. If a colleague has made changes to a document, these changes will be automatically synchronized locally to your computer. If you are working on it at the same time, then a conflict may occur in which you both are editing it at the same time.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;A shared folder must exist that all parties participating on the project are allowed to see. Once a folder has been identified and properly setup, all parties must select the folder for synchronization. &amp;nbsp;Once this has been setup and the folder created locally and content downloaded, it is as easy as selecting the document, opening locally, and working on it. &amp;nbsp;New documents can be added to the folder and will be distributed to colleagues who have selected the folder for synchronization.&amp;nbsp;Steps to setup a shared folderA shared folder must exist that all parties participating in the project have access to. There are two ways that this can be acomplishedOption 1: The Administrator sets up a folder for the project team.Coordinate with your SpringCM Administrator. The Administrator will in turn create a folder and assign security to the folder so that you and your colleagues can View, Edit, and optionally delete content from the folder.Once the folder has been setup by the Administrator, select the folder for synchronization.The folder and its content will be synchronized down to your desktop.Ensure that your colleagues select the folder for synchronization as well.Option 2: Share a folder from your home directory to share with your colleaguesThis option assumes that you adminstrator has allowed you to set permissions on your home folderPerform the following stepsLogin to SpringCMNavigate to your Home FolderSelect a folder to share.if the folder does not exist, create it.Set the security on the folder by performing the following stepsSelect Manage and SecurityEnter the user(s) that require access to the folder. Type in the first letters of the users name and then select the User.&amp;nbsp;Set SecurityNo Access: the user does not have access.&amp;nbsp;View: Provides view only security. The user can not edit documents.&amp;nbsp;View and Edit: Allows the user to view documents, add documents, and make changesView and Create: Allows the user to view existing documents and add new documents.View, Edit, and Delete: Allows the user to view documents, make changes, and delete documents.View, Edit, Delete, &amp;amp; Set Access:&amp;nbsp;Allows the user to view documents, make changes, and delete documents and set the security on folders.&amp;nbsp;Select Save.Communicate to your colleagues that they now have access to the newly created folder.Once your colleagues have access, instruct them to select this folder for synchronization.&amp;nbsp;Begin to collaborateOnce all parties have been selected the folder for synchronization, documents will be synchronized and you can start working together.&amp;nbsp;If a new documents is added to the folder, then these documents will be synchronized.If a document is renamed, then this document will be renamed and synchronized. (assuming permissions)If a document is deleted, then this document will be deleted and synchronized. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(assuming permissions)If a document is edited and saved, then this document will be updated and synchronized. (assuming permissions)If a folder is added and the sync'd folder, then this folder will added and synchronized. (assuming permissions)If a folder is renamed, then the folder will be renamed and synchronized (assuming permissions)If a document is edited on two different local machines and saved at the same time, a conflict may occur. This conflict is normal and indicates that a newer version of the document exists.&amp;nbsp;Changes made on other computers may not show up on your computer for up to 10 minutes. This is normal behavior.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?SpringCM account components  Folders, Documents, Attribute Groups, Security Groups, Forms, Smart Rules, Custom Reports, and Advanced Workflows _ can be packaged for transfer to other accounts.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Packaging is often used to move configurations (Workflows, Smart Rules, Folders) from one account to another.&amp;nbsp; Most likely, one account is in UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment and the other account is in the Production environment _ packaging allows you to easily move the configurations from &quot;testing&quot; to &quot;live&quot;, essentially.&amp;nbsp;To note, packaging is meant to transfer components of a solution, rather than a whole SpringCM account _ packaging is not meant to migrate a mass amount of content (documents) from one account to another.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?&amp;nbsp;Steps to create a package:In the Preferences tab, select Create PackageIn each package tab, select the components to be transferred. &amp;nbsp;When selecting Folders, use the checkboxes in the tab to include documents contained in the selected folders and/or group security settings if Security Groups will be added to the package.When selecting eForms, use the checkbox in the tab to include form documents from the selected eForms submit folders. If no submit folder is selected, the destination accounts root folder will become the submit folder for the transferred form. The properties of each eForm  submit and update status, attachments allowed, Public or Private _ will be displayed in the tab.Name the package and add a description of the package if desired.When all components have been selected click the Save button. A file with a .spackage extension and the new package name will be added to the user folder of the creator of the package.Transferring and Unpacking in the Destination AccountA package can be transferred to the destination account using any transfer method (FTP, WebDav, UI download/upload.) Users who need access to the package should have at least View and Edit privileges on the .spackage file.&amp;nbsp;Simply click the .spackage file to unpack the transferred components in the destination account. The package tabs will open and transferred components can be examined. Note that the package cannot be edited in the destination account. If the package requires corrections a new package should be created in the source account and transferred again to the destination account.When ready click the Install button and the transferred components will appear alongside like components in the destination account. A banner message will appear to confirm a successful transfer.After unpacking, the transferred .spackage file can be unpacked and transferred again as many times as needed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To Check Out a documentTo Edit a checked out document&amp;nbsp;with SpringCM EditTo Edit a checked out document by downloading from the SpringCM webclient and then checking inAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?To Edit a checked out document by downloading from the SpringCM webclient and then checking inThe Check Out and Check In features enable the SpringCM user to lock and unlock documents to control exclusive access for editing.When is it used?When a document is opened for editing from SpringCM it is, by default, not locked for exclusive access. This allows more than one user to simultaneously open and edit the document. When simultaneous edits occur, a user will receive a conflict resolution dialog upon save seeking input on how to handle the conflicting edits.Use the Check Out and Check In features when you want to ensure exclusive edit access and avoid simultaneous edits and conflicts. Only the person that checked out the document will be allowed to edit it. Other users with security rights to the document can view or download the checked out document, but they cannot upload revisions or delete a document while it is checked out.If you know that you will editing a document for an extended period of time or making extensive edits, it is best practice to check out the document first.How is it used?Check Out and Check In are explicit actions that must be taken on the part of the user. They are used in the following manner:To Check Out a documentClick the Documents tab and navigate to the folder containing the desired documentSelect the desired document by clicking its check box.Select Edit then Check Out from the menu bar, OR click the Check Out button located on the toolbar.Expected Results: The document will be checked out. Upon check_out the user will receive notification that if they want to edit the document, they should download the document. When a document has been checked_out, SpringCM displays a small padlock icon next to the document type icon. Hovering over the padlock will show you who checked it out, and the date/time it was checked_out.After the document is checked out in the SpringCM webclient by the user, the user has two choices for modifying the document and checking it back in: Editing with SpringCM Edit and downloading the document and then manually checking back in.To Edit a checked out document with SpringCM EditEdit the Document with SpringCM Edit:The user who checked out the document can Edit the document for exclusive editing by following these steps:If you just completed the check out, the desired document should be selected in your document list. If it is not, select the desired document by clicking its check box.&amp;nbsp;There are several ways to Edit the document:Select&amp;nbsp;File then Edit Document&amp;nbsp;from the menu bar.&amp;nbsp;Click the Edit Document (pencil icon) Action from the Action Menu.You will then see a pop up window on the local desktop indicating that the document is being downloaded to your computer. &amp;nbsp;Once the document has been downloaded, it will automatically be opened in the native application registered for the file extension.&amp;nbsp;After completing your edits, save the document and it will automatically be uploaded as a new version of the document and automatically checked back in.&amp;nbsp;Expected Results: If you select Edit document,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the document will be &amp;nbsp;automatically downloaded and opened in the default application registered for the file extension. &amp;nbsp;Saving the document locally will upload the document as a new version&amp;nbsp;AND check the document back in.&amp;nbsp;CAUTION:&amp;nbsp;Please be aware that if you keep the document open after saving the document above and continue editing, the document will not be checked out. If you want to ensure that it is locked for editing, you will need to check the document back out.&amp;nbsp;To Edit a checked out document by downloading from the SpringCM webclient and then checking inDownload the document from SpringCMAfter the document is checked out in the SpringCM webclient by the user, the user has two choices for modifying the document and checking it back in. &amp;nbsp;The user who checked out the document can download it for exclusive editing by following these steps:If you just completed the check out, the desired document should be selected in your document list. If it is not, select the desired document by clicking its check box.Select&amp;nbsp;File&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;Download&amp;nbsp;from the menu bar, OR click the&amp;nbsp;Download&amp;nbsp;button located on the toolbar.You will receive a pop_up dialog from your browser asking if you want to open or save the document. Select&amp;nbsp;Open&amp;nbsp;to both download and open the document in its associated application or&amp;nbsp;Save&amp;nbsp;to select a location on your local computer where the document should be downloaded to.Expected Results:&amp;nbsp;If you chose the&amp;nbsp;Open&amp;nbsp;option, the document will be downloaded to the default download directory for your browser and opened in the application associated with this document type. If you chose the&amp;nbsp;Save&amp;nbsp;option you will need to navigate to that directory on your local computer and manually open the document. In either case, please note the download location as you will need this for check in.Check In the DocumentWhen you are finished editing the document you checked out, you will need to manually check in the document to save your edits to SpringCM. Only the user who has checked out a document can check in the document. To check in the document, take the following steps:Click the&amp;nbsp;Documents&amp;nbsp;tab and navigate to the folder containing the checked out documentSelect the checked out document by clicking its check box.Select&amp;nbsp;Edit&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;Check In&amp;nbsp;from the menu bar, OR click the&amp;nbsp;Check In&amp;nbsp;button located on the toolbar.You will be presented with two options:&amp;nbsp;Choose a document from your computer&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;Choose a document from SpringCM.If you have selected&amp;nbsp;Choose a document from your computer,&amp;nbsp;click&amp;nbsp;Choose File.From Windows Explorer or the Mac Finder, locate the file that you want to check in from the directory to which it was downloaded. If you have moved the document to a new directory since the initial download, then select the file from the location from which you edited it.Highlight the file that you edited, then click the&amp;nbsp;Open&amp;nbsp;button on the Choose File dialog to select it. The file name to be checked in will be noted on the screen.If you have selected&amp;nbsp;Choose a document from SpringCM, then click&amp;nbsp;Select. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This will enable you to find a document that you may have uploaded &amp;nbsp;to SpringCM and check that document in as a new version in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;Optional:&amp;nbsp;You can add a description to describe the reason for the check in. This description will appear as the description for the new version that will be created upon check in.Click the&amp;nbsp;Save&amp;nbsp;button to upload and check in the document.Expected Results:&amp;nbsp;The selected file will be added as a new version to the selected checked out document in SpringCM, and the document will be unlocked. If the name of the file which was selected for check in varied from the name of the selected checked out document in SpringCM, then the name will be changed to match the original checked out document name. You will receive notification of this name change. You will also receive notification of the check in.Advanced ConceptsCancel Check Out _ If you have checked out a document and want to unlock it with out checking in a new version, you can do so by selecting the checked out document, then selecting Edit and Cancel Check Out from the menu bar. Only the user who checked out the document or a SpringCM Super Administrator can cancel a checked out document.Request Check In _ If someone else has a document checked out, and you want to gain access to edit the document, you can request a check in from the user who currently has it checked out. You can do so by selecting the checked out document, then selecting Edit and Request Check In from the menu bar. You cannot request check in for a document that you have checked out.Check In from the SpringCM document repository _ When checking in a document, the file to be added as a new version can be another document that is stored in SpringCM rather than a document from the local drive of the computer. This can be used to bring changes from one SpringCM document into a second SpringCM document. Simply check out the document for which you want to create a new version for, then select Check In. On the Check In dialog choose the option Choose a document in SpringCM. Use the dialog to select a document from SpringCM that will become the new version.Editing without Check Out _ Documents are typically opened for editing from SpringCM using the SpringCM Edit feature (also known as one_click edit). The SpringCM Edit module does not checkout the document upon download and open, and the document will be available for revision by other users. The SpringCM Edit module is used because of its convenience and will be used the majority of the time. For those times when you desire exclusive edit access, it is recommended that you use the Check Out feature and the steps outlined in this knowledge article to edit the document.History/Audit Trail _ When documents are checked out and checked in, the explicit actions are added to the document history. A canceled check out is also logged in the history. When viewing the document history you may see more document check in actions than you expect. There are two types of document check in actions _ explicit and implicit. An explicit document check in means that the user selected the Check In option. An implicit document check in will appear when the SpringCM Edit module or SpringCM Business Sync Module has uploaded a new version of the document. You can distinguish between the two based on the information in the &quot;Info&quot; column. An explicit document check in will be noted as &quot;via upload&quot; where as an implicit document check in will be noted as &quot;via SpringCM Web Service&quot;.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What Is It?&amp;nbsp;A Mandatory Folder has been identified by the Administrator as folder that should be automatically synchronized to your desktop. These folders will automatically be delivered to your desktop as part of synchronization with SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;Administrators can create mandatory folders by creating sync include rules. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When Is it used?&amp;nbsp;An Administrator may elect to set a mandatory folder at either the account level or at the security group level. &amp;nbsp;Common examples include the following:providing the most current templates to use for presentations, documents, and the like.providing the most up to date HR Information, forms, and documentationproviding the most current set of Sales, Marketing, or other key documentationIf you also subscribe to the folder and have permissions, you can make changes to these documents.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How is it used?These folders are identified in the Sync Client Client by the * in the folder. &amp;nbsp;To see which folders are mandatory (cannot by unchecked):Open&amp;nbsp;Sync clientGo to the&amp;nbsp;Sync tab&amp;nbsp;(upper left hand side)Click&amp;nbsp;Select FoldersLook for folders that have an asterisk (*) symbol on itClick OK to exit the Select Folders to Sync screenClick OK to exit the Sync client&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/business_sync_folder_selection_rules</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?What is the default behavior?What does Automatically Select Parent Folder Above in the folder tree mean?&amp;nbsp;How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;This options allows users to choose which folders they are interested in subscribing to in sync and what happens when a folder is selected in the folder tree. &amp;nbsp;There are two options for this. &amp;nbsp;The recommended option is the default option _ Only select children below in the folder tree. &amp;nbsp;This means that when you make a folder selection, all children folders will automatically be subscribed to. &amp;nbsp;The second option _ Automatically select parent folders above in the folder tree _ will not only allow for automatic subscription of children folders but parent folders as well. &amp;nbsp;Users have the option to sync any folder that he or she has access to in SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;Users will not be able to sync content that are not available to them due to access restrictions placed on the folders. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;When the user makes changes to their folder subscriptions. &amp;nbsp;Users can either choose to subscribe to a folder, meaning that they want the content of that folder synced to their desktop. &amp;nbsp;If a folder is not selected for sync, then the content in that folder will not be synced to the user's desktop. &amp;nbsp;Most of the time, only the folders a user works with the most are synced. &amp;nbsp;Syncing all the content and folders a user has access to may take up consideration space on your desktop. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is the default behavior?&amp;nbsp;The default behavior is labeled Only select children below in the folder tree. This can be changed in Options.Selecting a folder in the tree will auto_select all of its subfolders.Any new folder added to the folder in SpringCM or locally will be automatically subscribedDeselecting a folder will also de_select all of its subfolders&amp;nbsp;What does Automatically Select Parent Folder Above in the folder tree mean?&amp;nbsp;This is an alternate behavior that can be used in selecting folders for synchronization. In this case, selecting a folder in the tree will auto_select all of its subfolders. This is no different than the default behavior but if a parent folder exists, then this folder will also be synchronized to the computer and any new folders that are added to the parent folder will also synchronized to your computer.In this mode if a sub folder is de_selected, then it and its subfolders will not be subscribed. &amp;nbsp;A parent folder can be selected for synchronization and all subfolders underneath it de_selected for synchronization. When this occurs,Any unselected folders will not be synchronized.Any new sub_folders added to the parent folder will be automatically synchronized.All documents added to the parent folder will be synchronized.In this mode, if a sub_folder is selected and the parent has not been previously selected, the parent will be marked as selected. When this occurs,All new documents or folders added to Sanity Test Scripts will be automatically synchronizedAll new documents and sub_folders added to Desktop Sync Beta Program will be automatically synchronizedSub_folders or documents added to un_subscribed folders are not synchronized.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?To choose what happens when a folder is selected in a folder tree:Open Sync clientGo to the Sync tab (upper left hand side)Click Select FoldersChoose Options (lower left hand side)Select either Only select children below in the folder tree or the Automatically select parent folders above in the folder tree optionClick OK to exit the Folder Selection Method screenClick OK to exit Sync client&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Adding Attributes to Documents</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/adding_attributes_to_documents</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To add an attribute group to a documentTo add attribute values to a documentTo add values using attribute setsTo add multiple valuesAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?Attributes Feature Overview VideoYour SpringCM Super Administrator may have created one or more Attribute Groups which can be used to apply attributes to documents. By applying attributes to documents, you can classify documents to make it easier to search for the documents, find related documents, and trigger pre_defined rules and workflows.Before an Attribute Group can be used, it has to be defined by your SpringCM Super Administrator. See the knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups for detailed instructions on how to setup Attribute Groups. If you are a SpringCM user and you want to use an Attribute Group that has already been setup by your administrator, refer to this knowledge article for more information.When is it used?Assuming Attribute Groups have been setup for your account, use this knowledge article to learn how to associate an attribute group to a document and add attribute values.How is it used?Attributes are added to documents in SpringCM using the Document Preview and Navigation pane. If you are not familiar with this feature, please review the knowledge article titled Document Preview and Navigation Panel.To add an attribute group to a documentSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu bar.Navigate to the folder containing your document.Click on the document name to go into preview mode.If it is not already expanded, expand the navigation panel.Select Attributes from the menu bar to see a list of available attribute groups.Note: The attribute groups which are available for selection will be determined based on the groups setup by your SpringCM administrator AND by the folder settings, which allow for the restriction on the use of attribute groups within a folder.Choose the desired Attribute group.Expected Results: Upon selection the attribute group will be added to the navigation panel on the left, and it will be visible so that attribute values may be applied to the document.To add attribute values to a documentHow you go about adding an attribute value to a document will depend on how the attribute value was defined. Well defined attributes will provide for content validation (i.e., limiting the entry to a list of valid values), format validation (i.e., making sure entries are entered in a particular format), and multiple entries where appropriate. Assuming your SpringCM administrator has following best practices for setting up attributes, applying the attribute values should be straightforward. The following instructions provide some general guidelines for applying the attributes.Refer to the following diagram containing an image of a the navigation pane with an Attribute Group called Demo, as you learn more about adding attributes to documents.Expand the navigation panel in Document Preview.If the attribute group is not already visible, add it using the steps noted in the preceding section.An attribute group can be expanded and collapsed within the navigation pane to expose or hide the attributes using the left_facing for down_facing triangle next to the attribute group name.&amp;nbsp; If the attribute group is collapsed, click on the left_facing triangle to expand it.As you examine the attributes within a group, you may see some attributes with a red asterisk next to the attribute label. This means that the attribute is required, and you must enter a value for it if you intend to use the attribute group.Attribute fields will completed in one of three ways:Drop Down: Use the drop down arrow to select a valid value.Free Form: Simply enter a valid value using the label as a indication of the value that should be placed there. Free Form fields often have format validation applied to it to make sure that you are entering a value in the proper format (i.e., phone number as (###) ###_####, etc.)Date Selector: You can manually enter the date in the format MM/DD/YYYY or click on the calendar tool to select a date from a calendar date picker.Complete each attribute field as required.Click Apply or Save on the navigation bar to save the entered attribute values.Expected Results: Your entries will be validated upon save. If you have free form fields that are not in the proper form, they will be checked and you will be notified of any errors. If you have required fields that are not provided, you will be notified that you must provide a value. Fields defined as type of decimal will be formated to two decimal places to the right of the decimal point.To add values using attribute setsAn attribute set is one or more attributes that are grouped together into a logical set and assigned a name. An attribute set can be expanded and collapsed within the navigation pane to expose or hide the attributes using the left_facing for down_facing triangle next to the attribute set name.The attribute sets will be separated from other attributes using a horizontal line to provide visual indication that the fields form a logical set.If the attribute set is collapsed, click on the left_facing triangle to expand it.Complete the attribute fields in the attribute set as you would any other attribute field.Click Apply or Save on the navigation bar to save the entered attribute values.To add multiple valuesAttribute fields and attribute sets can be marked as repeatable. A repeatable field or set means that you can have more than one occurrence of the field or set within the attribute group. If your SpringCM Administrator setup the attribute group with a repeatable field or set, then you can add as many occurrences of the field or set as you require when filling out the attribute group values.If a field is marked as repeatable, there will be an option titled Add Field at the bottom of the last entry.If a set is marked as repeatable, there will be an option titled Add Set at the bottom of the set.If you want to add additional values, simply click Add Field or Add Set to add an additional entry field for the attribute or to add an additional set of attributes for the attribute set.Advanced ConceptsApplying Default Attribute Values _ Rather than manually applying defaults as is discussed in this knowledge article you can have default values automatically applied to documents as they are uploaded to a folder. See the knowledge article titled Default Document Attributes for instructions on how to setup these default entries.Applying Attribute Values in Bulk _ When migrating many documents or even when attempting to update many documents at one time, it is often not practical to manually update each document. SpringCM provides a method by which attributes can be applied to documents in bulk. See the knowledge article titled Bulk Attribute Assignment for more details.</content:encoded>

        <title>Approval Workflow Templates</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/approval_workflow_templates</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create an Approval Workflow TemplateTo use an Approval Workflow TemplateTo modify a templateWhat is it?Approval Workflow Templates allow you to create reusable approval workflows which can be used by any user to easily launch workflows without the need to configure workflow steps. This ability to choose from a pre_defined set of steps reduces the time necessary to activate an Approval Workflow.The template can be modifiable or non_modifiable based on its definition. A non_modifiable template will not allow the participants or steps of the workflow to be changed after selecting the template. A modifiable template will allow the user to configure or change participants and steps after the initial template settings are applied. The workflow name and the selected documents will always be configurable regardless of the template type.When is it used?An Approval Workflow Template can be created by any SpringCM user when he or she identifies an approval process that is frequently repeated. By saving these repetitive steps as a template, the user can avoid the need to define the process time and time again, choosing instead to use the template and letting the template define the participant's and the steps.How is it used?The process of creating an approval workflow template is much like creating an approval workflow itself, with a few minor exceptions:Templates can be saved without documents associated with them.Templates can be marked as modifiable or non_modifiable.To create an Approval Workflow TemplateSelect GOTO then Workflows from the menu bar to go to the Workflows workspaceSelect Manage then Approval Templates from the menu bar. A list of all of the defined workflow templates for the current account will appear.Select Templates then Create template from the menu bar, or click Create Template on the toolbar. The Create Workflow dialog will appear.Enter a descriptive Name for this template.&amp;nbsp; This is the name that will appear in the template drop down when defining an approval workflow, and it will serve as the initial name for an approval workflow that is based on the template.If you do not specify a name it will use the document name (if also specified). If neither is specified, then it will use a generic name. It is considered best practice to provide a meaningful name so that it will be easily distinguished in the Template drop down.If you want to associate documents with the template, click Select Documents. It is not necessary to do so.If you specify documents, they will be added to the approval workflow that is based on the template, but the user will be able to change or remove them.If you do not specify documents, then the user will have to specify at least one document for the approval workflow based on the template, because a document is required for an approval workflow.Provide Instructions for the workflow. If the template is marked as modifiable, then the user will be able to change the instructions in the approval workflow based on the template. Otherwise, they will not be able to change these instructions.Click the Add Step button to add a step to the workflowClick Add Users to add one or more users who are to be assigned to the step. Optionally, you can start typing the name or email address of the assigned user(s) in the assigned to box.When assigning multiple users to a step, check or uncheck the All option to define how to interpret the assignment. Unchecked means only one of the assigned users must complete that step. Checked means every assigned user must complete step. If only one user is assigned to the task the All option will be disabled.Select the expected action that should be taken by the assigned user for this step.Approve _ indicates that the assigned user(s) must make an approval decisionEdit _ indicates that the assigned user(s) is only required to edit the documentSet an optional duration time. If no duration is set, the step will stay with the assigned user(s) until the action is completed or overridden by a workflow administrator. However, if a duration is set, then if the user does not complete the task within the configured duration, the step will be skipped and workflow will progress to the next task.Set an optional Reminder interval. This is the frequency with which the user will be the reminded to complete the task until the task is either completed or skipped.If the approval workflow template requires additional steps, repeat steps 8 through 13.Complete the definition by clicking the Save button at the top or bottom of the page.Expected Results: The new template will be added to the list of available templates for the account and will be available for any user (full subscriber or above) to use, edit or delete.To use an Approval Workflow TemplateInitiate the definition of the approval workflow. See the knowledge article titled Approval Workflows for more information.Use the Template drop down to choose from the list of pre_defined templates.Review and update the workflow name if you do not like the initial value set by the template.Review and update any documents added by the template, and if you require different or additional documents, use the Select Documents option to change or add them.Review and update the Instructions. If the template was marked as non_modifiable, you will not be able to change the instructions.Review and update the workflow steps and their associated assignments. If the template was marked as non_modifiable, you will not be able to change the steps or the assignments.Click the Start button at the top or bottom of the page to initiate your workflow.To modify a templateAn existing approval workflow template can be edited by any SpringCM user using the steps shown below:Select GOTO then Workflows from the menu bar to go to the Workflows Workspace.Select Manage then Approval Templates from the menu bar.A list of all of the defined workflow templates for the current account will appear. An Action drop down to the right of each template name will allow you to work with the existing template.Use the Actions drop down to select Edit Template.Modify the template as desired.Click Save to save the template.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?What features are available?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?The Account Security link, located in the Preferences workspace, enables super administrators to set security preferences that apply to all users in the current or primary account.&amp;nbsp; The account security section is where you manage all your security options.&amp;nbsp; This is where you establish password requirements, number of consecutive failed login attempts allowed, number of minutes a user can be idle before the session times out.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?The account security link is primarily used to manage security settings to comply with a company's security policies.&amp;nbsp; SpringCM provides a lot of flexibility for system administrator to fit security options to the needs of a company.&amp;nbsp;What Features are Available?Force Users to Use Strong Passwords _&amp;nbsp;Click the Enable or Disable radio button to force users to use passwords between eight and 25 characters in length containing letters and non_letters (numbers, symbols, etc ...).Session Timeout _&amp;nbsp;Enter the number of minutes users' sessions can remain idle before a session timeout occurs. 20 minutes is the default session timeout. The maximum time allowed before a session timeout occurs is 45 minutes.Password Expiration _&amp;nbsp;Enter the number of days before users' passwords will expire. Enter &quot;0&quot; to disable password expiration, allowing users to use the same password indefinitely. The password_expiration timeframe cannot exceed 365 days.Password History Size _&amp;nbsp;Enter the number of previous passwords that cannot be reused. Enter &quot;0&quot; to allow users unlimited password reuse. Enter &quot;1&quot; to retain only the most current password as a previous password, alleviating users from memorizing their previous passwords but ensuring their new passwords are unique. SpringCM can remember up to 99 passwords.Maximum Login Attempts _&amp;nbsp;Enter the maximum number of times you will allow users consecutive failed login attempts. Once users have exceeded the specified number of consecutive failed login attempts, they will be prohibited from the SpringCM login page. Enter &quot;0&quot; or leave the field blank to allow users unlimited login attempts.Authorized IP Addresses _&amp;nbsp;An IP address is a numerical code given to computers connected to a network. To restrict computers in non_authorized networks from accessing SpringCM, enter the IP addresses that are authorized to access SpringCM in a comma_separated list. To allow access from all IP addresses, leave the list blank. You can also list regular expressions, a method of text_pattern matching.An example list may resemble the following: 67.152.168, 67.152.167Listing IP addresses that do not include your current workstation's IP address will end your session after you click the Save button.Login Hours _&amp;nbsp;Enter appropriate times during which users can access SpringCM in the Start Time and End Time fields. Enter times in a 24_hour clock format where 8 a.m. is 08:00 and 3 p.m. is 15:00.All times are relative to the Account Time Zone settings found in Account Preferences. For example, if the Account Time Zone is set for Central Time, specifying a start time of 08:00 (8 a.m.) and end time of 18:00 (6 p.m.) means users in Eastern Time can access this account from 09:00 (9 a.m.) to 19:00 (7 p.m.).Entering a start time and end time that does not include the current time will end your session after you click the Save button.Login Days of Week _&amp;nbsp;Check which days of the week users are allowed to access SpringCM by clicking the appropriate Days of the Week check boxes. Leave all check boxes intact to allow users 24/7 access to SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;Checking days but not including the current day of the week will end your session.Share _&amp;nbsp;Determine whether or not the account is allow to share links publicly.&amp;nbsp; Checking the 'Allow Public Links' allow users to publicly share documents with individuals that are not members of your SpringCM account. Anyone with the link will be able to view and/or download the document.&amp;nbsp; The permission on the document required for sharing it is also set here.&amp;nbsp; By default, only those who have the ability to set access to a document can share the document.&amp;nbsp; However, those who have View and Edit permission can share links if permitted by the super administrator.&amp;nbsp; For more information on sharing link, go to the Share Link knowledge article.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How is it used?Click the Account Security link located in the PreferencesSet security preferences for the primary account.When you've finished modifying Account Security settings, click the Save button.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create/edit Address Book entriesTo send a documentAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?The Address Book feature is used to administer SpringCM users, contacts, security groups and distribution groups.&amp;nbsp;Users are individuals who will login to your SpringCM account to view and/or edit documents. A individual user requires a user license.Contacts are individuals who will not login to your SpringCM account but are included in your address book because you may want to include them as recipients on emails when sending documents from SpringCM. A contact does not require a user license.Security Groups are groups of Users which allow you to define security based on group membership rather than individual user names.Distribution Groups are groups of Contacts or Users which allow you to send emails to a group rather than listing each recipient individually.Typical administrative Address Book tasks include adding new users, contacts, security groups, and distribution groups, changing group membership, assigning a role to a user, defining a user's persona, and password reset.When is it used?The Address Book feature is used whenever users, contacts, security groups, or distribution groups need to be created, edited or removed. It may also be used to reset user passwords.In addition to these administrative tasks, the Address Book may also be used to send SpringCM documents to users, contacts, or distributions groups which are maintained in the Address Book.How is it used?To access the Address Book, select GO TO then Address Book from the menu bar.All Users, Contacts, Security Groups and Distribution Groups will be listed alphabetically by name. Click the desired letter of the alphabet to quickly locate a user or contact whose last name starts with the selected letter. You can also sort this list by another column, or use the Show option to limit the type of Address Book entry to display.Each User will be assigned a particular role. See the knowledge article titled User Roles for details on the meaning of each role. The list of users can also be filtered based on role.The menu bar encompasses all functionality available in the Address Book. The toolbar contains buttons for creating each Address Book entry type.&amp;nbsp;To create/edit Address Book entriesSee Create and Edit a SpringCM UserSee Create and Edit a SpringCM ContactSee Security GroupsSee Distribution GroupsTo send a documentFrom the Address Book tab, select the Contacts or Users you want to whom you want to send a documentSelect Send then SpringCM Email from the menu bar.Review the recipient list to ensure that all your select Contacts and Users are listed. If not, add additional.Provide a subject and a messageClick Selected Items to add the documents you want to send as attachments. Repeat for each document you want to attach.Check how you want the documents to be sent:Original _ Document will be sent in its native format (e.g.., Word)PDF _ Document will be converted to PDF format before being attachedLink _ A link to the document will be sent, and the recipient will need to login to SpringCM to review it. If you choose to send as a link, Contacts will not be able to login to SpringCM to see the documents.Click the Send button located at the bottom or top of the Send Documents window.Advanced ConceptsImporting multiple users _ If you are deploying SpringCM to a large number of users, you can perform a bulk import of users rather than creating them one at a time. Refer to the knowledge article User Bulk Load for details on how to do this either directly from the Address Book or via an automated process.Contact Visibility _ You can determine who can see the contacts added to your Address Book. Refer to the knowledge article Create and Edit a SpringCM Contact for additional information.Password Reset _ A SpringCM administrator may from time to time be required to reset a user's password. This is done through the Address Book feature. Refer to the knowledge article Reset Password for additional information.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Pre_requisitesStep 1: Create a custom CSV data fileStep 2: Create a SpringCM Attribute Import MappingStep 3: Create a SpringCM Document RuleStep 4: Upload the custom CSV fileAdditional ReferenceWhat is it?Bulk Metadata Import, an action possible through use of a Smart Rule, enables SpringCM Administrators to assign unique attribute values to up to 500 SpringCM documents at a time without manually entering document attributes. It is a multi_step process which requires you to create an input data file (typically a CSV), an Attribute Import Mapping, and a Document Rule.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Bulk Metadata Import is used when many unique attributes need to be applied to many documents at the same time. All the files to be updated must be in the same folder for this functionality to work, as This functionality is not meant for applying attributes to files across multiple folders.This method is frequently used during migration of documents from another system to SpringCM.How is it used?Pre_requisitesBefore configuring the CSV, Document Rule, and Mapping, ensure all attributes and attributes groups are created and formatted as they will appear in the CSV file. Refer to the knowledge article Creating and Managing Attribute Groups for more information.Upload the documents in bulk into only one SpringCM folder (i.e., later you will upload the CSV file to this same folder). Documents can be uploaded in bulk via any upload method. We recommend using SFTP or WebDAV when uploading a large number of documents.Step 1:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Create a custom CSV data fileThis file will contain the attribute information associated with each filename organized under columns formatted with group.field as the header. &amp;nbsp;All attribute values entered into the cells of the CSV file MUST contain a valid value for the specified attribute, including drop_down field values. &amp;nbsp;Dates should be entered in a &quot;mm/dd/yyyy&quot; format. &amp;nbsp;The filenames should be listed in column one, and that column should have no header.For example, a CSV file for a bulk import of resumes would contain information in this format below. &amp;nbsp;The document names in a folder is listed on the left_hand side. &amp;nbsp;The attribute group.attribute field is listed in the column headers and the attribute values are filled out in the other CSV value fields.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Resumes.Last NameResumes.First NameResumes.PositionWorld Class1.docxSmithJohnDirector of MarketingWorld Class2.docxJonesGeorgeVp of Sales&amp;nbsp;Step 2: Create a SpringCM Attribute Import MappingSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Attribute Import Mappings from the Account Preferences tree.Click the New Mapping radio button.Enter a name in the New Mapping field.Open the Type drop_down menu and select CSV.Type 2 in the &quot;Data Starts At&quot; field (assuming a file of the format shown above).Open the Mapping menu and click the Add Mapping Element option.Assign a column number,&amp;nbsp;the filename and appropriate attribute fields (formatted as Attribute Group.Attribute Field) for each element. &amp;nbsp;Note: Assign the Filename dropdown option to column 1.Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the remaining columns. The numbers assigned to each column must match the order of the corresponding columns in the custom CSV.Click the Save button.&amp;nbsp;Step 3: Create SpringCM Document RuleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from the Account Preferences tree.Open the Rule menu and select the New option.Enter a short description in the Name field (for example  &quot;AP Invoice Migration&quot;).Open the For Event drop_down menu and select the Document Entered Folder option.Open the Filters drop_down menu and select the Has Name Like option.Enter &quot;*.csv&quot; in the Filters field. &amp;nbsp;Asterisks (*) function as wildcards throughout SpringCM.Click the Add button to add the name filter.Return to the Filters drop_down menu and select the In Folder option.Click the Select Folder button, choose the target folder (where the documents are in), and click the Select button.Click the Add button to add the folder filter if necessary.Open the Actions drop_down menu and select the Bulk Metadata Import option.Click the Add button.Click the Save button.You must enable the rule. To enable the rule, click the check box located to the left of the Document Rule then select Rule then Enable from the menu bar.&amp;nbsp; Step 4: Activate UploadUpload the CSV file into the folder which contains the documents and which was specified in the &quot;In Folder&quot; filter of your rule. &amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;Bulk Attribute Assignment will begin immediately, and SpringCM will send e_mail notifications to the user who last modified the rule if any exceptions or failures arise.Additional ReferenceSetting up Bulk Attribute Import requires application of SpringCM Attribute Groups, Smart Rules, and Attribute Import Mappings. The steps above will walk you through the process to get you started.

        <title>Auto Number Attribute</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/auto_number_attribute</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Step 1: Setup an auto number definitionStep 2: Add an auto number attribute field to an attribute groupStep 3: Create a smart rule to trigger the auto number fieldAdvanced ConceptsEditing an auto number definitionTriggering an auto number using an attribute defaultWhat is it?The Auto Number Attribute is used to automatically assign a unique identifier to a document in SpringCM, eliminating the need for manual entry, avoiding human error, and ensuring uniqueness. A formatting template may be applied to the Auto Number Attribute if a particular pattern is desired for the unique identifier. Once defined, each new document associated with the attribute group containing the Auto Number Attribute will be assigned the next number in sequence. Once applied, the attribute field containing an Auto Number cannot be removed from a document, ensuring that the document can always be identified by the unique number. This knowledge article assumes that you are already familiar with attribute groups. If you are are not familiar with attribute groups refer first to our knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups. Only SpringCM Super Administrators can setup an Auto Number Attribute.When is it used?Use an Auto Number Attribute whenever you want to create a unique identifier for a document that will be automatically assigned in sequential order. Having a unique document number allows you to quickly and confidently retrieve the correct document. Simply search on the unique document number.This feature can be particularly useful when working with numerous documents of the same type. For example, contract management, legal, invoicing and application management are excellent use cases for the implementation of Auto Number. It is a desirable feature if you are migrating from another enterprise content management solution which has a unique document identifier.How is it used?Setting up an automatic Auto Number Attribute is a multi_step process, which requires you to do the following: Setup an auto number definition (name, value and format) Add an auto number field to the attribute groupSetup a smart rule to apply attribute group to documents, thereby triggering the attribute field to be populated with the next available number (optional)Each step is discussed in detail below.Step 1: Setup an auto number definitionSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Auto Numbers from the Account Preferences treeDefine the name of your Auto Number. A recommended best practice is to match the name of your Auto Number definition to the name of your attribute group.(Optional) Define a prefix or a suffix of your Auto Number.&amp;nbsp; For example, if you have a specific naming convention for your Auto Number like VENDOR_0001_ABCCompany, the prefix would be 'VENDOR_', the Auto Number is the number itself and the suffix would be 'ABCCompany'(Optional) Define the number width (in number of digits) of your Auto Number field.&amp;nbsp; SpringCM will pad this number with leading zeros.&amp;nbsp; For instance, if you set the width to 3 and your starting number is 1, then the first number would be 001Define the number that you want the Auto Number to start with.&amp;nbsp; If the value is left blank, the first number will be 1.Save your Auto NumberStep 2: Add an auto number attribute field to an attribute groupAfter the Auto Number has been defined, it can be associated with an attribute field in the desired attribute group. To do this:Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Attributes from the Account Preferences treeOpen the Attribute Group to which you want to add an Auto Number fieldClick +Field and name the new fieldUnder the Select Type dropdown, choose Auto NumberChoose the Auto Number name that you want to apply to the attribute field (as was previously defined in Step 1)Save your attribute groupStep 3: Create a smart rule to trigger the auto number fieldThis step is optional and is necessary only if you want the auto number field to be applied automatically when a document is uploaded. If you do not implement the smart rule, the auto number field can be triggered simply by manually applying the attribute group containing this field to the document in Document Preview. You can also use Attribute Defaults to trigger the auto number field as discussed in Advanced Concepts below.If you are not familiar with how to create a smart rule, refer to the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for more detailed instructions.Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from within the Account Preferences section of the tree.Select Rule then New Document Rule from the menu bar.Type in a descriptive name for the rule in the Name field (required).Apply the desired Event and Filters. See the example below.Define a new action to assign the attribute group containing your auto number field to the documents entering the field. See the example below.Save the Smart RuleEnable the Smart RuleExample:Name:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Trigger Auto Number FieldEvent:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Document Entered FolderExecute As:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specific UserFilter(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Folder /Account/rootfolder/foldernameAction(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign Attribute Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; w/attribute group={group containing auto number field}Advanced ConceptsEditing an auto number name, value and formatSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Auto Numbers from the Account Preferences treeClick on the edit pencil icon of the Auto Number you are interested in changingModify any of its properties.Note: If you wish to reassign a new start value, you must check the Restart checkbox next to the Start Value field.&amp;nbsp; Doing this may lead to duplicates or gaps in the number sequence and should be used with caution.Save your Auto NumberTriggering an auto number using an attribute defaultIf a default value is applied to documents in a folder using a Default Document Attribute, and that same attribute group also has an auto number attribute field in it, then the auto number attribute field will be automatically applied along with any other default value that is specified. You can select the auto number attribute field directly when adding default document attributes.&amp;nbsp;This is beneficial in two ways. First, any new document that is added to the folder will have the default values applied, and that will include the auto number field, thereby eliminating the need for the smart rule that was discussed above in Step 3. Secondly, if you have a set of documents already in the folder which do not have an autonumber applied to them, it will apply to default to all documents, thereby assigning the next auto number value in sequence to each one of the documents. This later is a very powerful feature to populating auto number fields in bulk.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Attribute Import Mapping</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/attribute_import_mapping</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To configure an Attribute Import Mapping for a CSV FileHow to Manifest File Configuration for XML FormatHow to Modify an Existing MappingWhat is it?Attribute Import Mappings enables SpringCM Administrators to configure how manifest files should be interpreted. Manifest files are used for bulk migration of documents, and provide the document attributes which are to be applied to the documents after upload. Manifest files are typically provided by a scanner or service bureau who has digitized your physical documents. The format of the manifest files will vary. If the manifest file is editable, you can manually configure the CSV file to put in it the expected default format. However, if the manifest file cannot be modified, Attribute Import Mappings is used to tell SpringCM how to interpret the manifest file.When is it used?Use Attribute Import Mapping whenever you are trying to apply attributes in bulk to a set of documents within a single folder using a manifest file. This is a common requirement when you are converting from another ECM system to SpringCM or when converting paper documents to electronic format for ingestion into SpringCM.Instructions for how to bulk upload and assign attributes in bulk using a manifest file can be found in the knowledge article titled Bulk Attribute Assignment. Refer to this knowledge article if you require more details on how to define an Attribute Import Mapping.How is it used?To configure an Attribute Import Mapping for a&amp;nbsp; CSV fileUse this method when your manifest file is in CSV format. The Attribute Import Mapping allows you to designate which columns in the CSV file represent each of the attribute fields to be applied to the document.Each column in the CSV file is represented in the Attribute Import Mapping as a mapping element. For every column in the CSV file, you will need to create a new mapping element, label it, and choose its corresponding attribute field. You label mapping elements by their column numbers, where the columns are numbered beginning with 1 moving from left to right.A mapping element is required for the file name. The file name can be in any column of the manifest file and the mapping can be present anywhere within the Attribute Import Mapping element list, but it must be provided. This will provide the name that will be used to find the document in the folder so as to apply the attributes.It is recommended that file names be unique to ensure that attributes are applied as expected. If a file name appears twice in the manifest file but only once in the folder, then the last set of attribute values provided will be applied to the document in the folder. If a document name appears twice in the folder, then only the first occurrence of the document will have the attribute values applied.To configure the mappingSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Attribute Import Mappings from the Account Preferences treeClick the New Mapping radio button.Enter a name in the New Mapping field.Open the Type drop_down menu and select CSV.Type the appropriate number in the &quot;Data Starts At&quot; field.Note: If the manifest file contains a header row, enter &quot;2&quot; in the &quot;Data Starts At&quot; field. If the manifest file does not contain a header row, enter &quot;1&quot;. If the manifest file contains multiple header rows, enter the number for the row in which the data starts.Select Mapping then Create Mapping Element from the menu bar.In the mapping element, enter the number of the column in the CSV file that contains the imported documents' file names.Click the Metadata Field drop_down menu and select the Filename option.Select Mapping then Create Mapping Element from the menu bar.In the mapping element, specify the column number and the appropriate attribute group and attribute field for each column.Click the Save button.How to Manifest File Configuration for XML FormatAttribute Import Mappings allows you to designate which Xpaths in an XML manifest file represent which attribute fields in SpringCM. To learn more about XML and Xpaths, consult the Microsoft Developer Network's Xpath Tutorial and Xpath Examples articles.Each Xpath in the XML file is represented in Attribute Import Mapping as a mapping element. For every Xpath in the XML file, you will need to create a new mapping element, to enter the Xpath in the Expression field, and to choose its corresponding attribute field from the Metadata Field drop_down menu.For example, if you are importing documents that use the attribute field InvoiceNumber found in the attribute group Invoice but the Xpath leading to the invoice number in the XML file reads //Invoice/InvoiceNumber/text(), you would enter //Invoice/InvoiceNumber/text() in the Xpath field and choose Invoices.InvoiceNumber from the Metadata Field drop_down menu.A mapping element is required for the file name. The file name can be in any column of the manifest file and the mapping can be present anywhere within the Attribute Import Mapping element list, but it must be provided. This will provide the name that will be used to find the document in the folder so as to apply the attributes.To configure the mappingSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Attribute Import Mappings from the Account Preferences treeClick the New Mapping radio button.Enter a name in the New Mapping field.Open the Type drop_down menu and select XML.Select Mapping then Create Mapping Element from the menu bar.In the mapping element, enter the XPATH that contains the imported documents' file names.Click the Metadata Field drop_down menu and select the Filename option.Select Mapping then Create Mapping Element from the menu bar.In the mapping element, specify the XPATH and the appropriate attribute group and attribute field for each column.Click the Save button.How to Modify an Existing MappingIf you need to modify an existing mapping, follow these steps:Add a mapping element _ Select Mapping menu then Create Mapping Element option from the menu bar. You cannot rearrange the order of mapping elements.Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Attribute Import Mappings from the Account Preferences treeClick the Existing Mapping radio button and select the appropriate mapping from the drop down.Execute the desired action as noted below:Delete the entire mapping _ Select Preferences then Delete Mapping from the menu barDelete one or multiple mapping elements _ Click the appropriate mapping element check boxes, then select Mapping and Delete Mapping Element from the menu bar.</content:encoded>

        <title>Approval Workflows</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/approval_workflows</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To define and start an Approval WorkflowTo approve a document in an approval workflowTo edit a document in an approval workflowTo manage your approval workflowWhat is it?Approval Workflows provide an easy way to automate the editing, review, and approval of documents between multiple SpringCM users. Using Approval Workflows keeps simple business processes running smoothly by eliminating manual task management.With an Approval Workflow, you can:Create an ordered list of tasks for SpringCM users to review, edit, and approve documents.Include a timeline for how long each user has to complete assigned tasks.Check the progress of a task and remind users of their deadlines.Adjust tasks to accommodate different deadlines, documents, and users.Add or remove tasks.The key advantage to using Approval Workflows is that you are no longer responsible for manually ensuring users complete their assigned tasks. By assigning tasks and deadlines in an approval workflow, SpringCM manages the process automatically and alerts users when they have tasks to complete.When is it used?Use an Approval Workflow whenever you are collaborating on a document with another SpringCM user, and you want to automate the tasks associated with that collaboration such as document review, editing and approval.&amp;nbsp;For example, a finance manager could start an approval workflow to approve a services contract that involves four colleagues _ each participant would have a step to complete (edit or approve), and SpringCM would automatically notify each user of their step, as well as provide a history of each event through the workflow collaboration. Another example might be an HR policy team that collaborates to edit and approve corporate procedures.The ease and flexibility of Approval Workflows make for a natural fit in a wide variety of organizations that work on countless types of documents.How it is used?To define and start an Approval WorkflowSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate the folder tree until you find the document(s) that you want to include in the approval workflow.Click to place a checkmark in front of the document(s) you want to includeSelect Send then For Approval from the menu barEnter a descriptive Name for this workflow.&amp;nbsp; This is what will show up in the participant's workflow inbox.&amp;nbsp; If a workflow name is not entered, the document name will show in the workflow inbox.Select an optional Template from the Template drop down if one has been pre_defined . A template contains a pre_defined set of steps which will provide a starting point and will eliminate the need for you to define the steps of the workflow.The documents that you selected in step 3 above will be associated with the workflow. If you want to select additional documents, click Select Documents to add more.The Instructions field is a free form area that will appear in the workflow inbox and page and in the email the participant user will get when they have a step to complete. Provide whatever instructions you would like.Click the Add Step button to add a step to the workflowClick Add Users to add one or more users who are to be assigned to the step. Optionally, you can start typing the name or email address of the assigned user(s) in the assigned to box.When assigning multiple users to a step, check or uncheck the All option to define how to interpret the assignment. Unchecked means only one of the assigned users must complete that step. Checked means every assigned user must complete step. If only one user is assigned to the task the All option will be disabled.Select the expected Action that should be taken by the assigned user for this step.Approve _ indicates that the assigned user(s) must make an approval decisionEdit _ indicates that the assigned user(s) is only required to edit the documentSet an optional Duration time. If no duration is set, the step will stay with the assigned user(s) until the action is completed or overridden by a workflow administrator. However, if a duration is set and if the user does not complete the task within the configured duration, the step will be skipped and workflow will progress to the next task.Set an optional Reminder interval. This is the frequency with which the user will be the reminded to complete the task until the task is either completed or skipped.If the approval workflow requires additional steps, repeat steps 9 through 14.Complete the definition and start the workflow by clicking the Start button at the top or bottom of the page.&amp;nbsp;Expected Results: When the workflow is started, SpringCM willAlert all participants via email that they may be assigned a task.&amp;nbsp;Send an email to each of the first participant(s) indicating they have a workflow task to complete.To approve a document in an approval workflowIf you are assigned an approval task within an approval workflow, you will receive an email notifying you of the requirement to complete the task. A sample of such an email is shown below.A new Approve task has been assigned to you by NameComplete your task here: Workflow InboxName: Simple Approval WorkflowExpiration: 24 hoursAssignees: Your NameInstructions:These are the custom instructions that you can provide to the user.History:Contact Name if you have any questions regarding this workflow.The email will indicate that an approval task as been assigned to you, and provide additional instructions. It also contains a link to the&amp;nbsp;Workflow Inbox&amp;nbsp;where the participant will go to complete the task. A sample of what the&amp;nbsp;Workflow Inbox&amp;nbsp;would look like is shown below. For additional information on how to work within the Workflow Inbox, see the knowledge article titled&amp;nbsp;Workflow Workspace.Click on the link in the email to go to the Workflow Inbox.From within the Workflow Inbox, click on the Workflow nameYou will be redirected to a special&amp;nbsp;Document Preview&amp;nbsp;screen. Here you will see the workflow instructions at the top of the screen. On the Navigation Panel, you will see options for approving or rejecting the document.Review the document using preview mode, PDF mode, or native mode.If the workflow step contains multiple documents, choose another document from the Document drop_down located at the top of the Document Preview screen.When you have completed your review, click on either the Approve or Reject option in the navigation panel to signify the results of your review. Enter any Comments about your reasons for approving or rejecting the documents.Expected Results: The document will close and the user will be returned to the workflow inbox. The completed task will be removed from the workflow inbox. The workflow creator will be notified that the task has been complete, and if the document was approved or rejected.To edit a document in an approval workflowIf you are assigned an edit task within an approval workflow, you will receive an email notifying you of the requirement to complete the task.Click on the link in the email to go to the Workflow Inbox.From within the Workflow Inbox, click on the Workflow nameYou will be redirected to a special&amp;nbsp;Document Preview&amp;nbsp;screen. Here you will see the workflow instructions at the top of the screen. On the Navigation Panel, you will see an option for indicating when you have completed your edits.You can either edit the contents of the document using SpringCM's&amp;nbsp;Check_out/Check_in&amp;nbsp;feature or annotate the document with comments which using&amp;nbsp;Pinpoint.If the workflow step contains multiple documents, choose another document from the Document drop_down located at the top of the Document Preview screen.When you have completed your edits or annotations, click on the Done option in the navigation panel to signify the results of your review. Enter any Comments about your edits that you would like to share with the workflow owner.To manage your approval workflowWhen you define an approval workflow, a workflow administration task will be added to your personal Workflow Inbox (i.e., in addition to the individual workflow tasks that will appear in participants workflow inboxes). This administrative task will allow you to monitor the status of your workflow and take action to override participant steps if desired.Select GOTO then Workflows from the menu barLocate the workflow administrative task in your Workflow Inbox.Click the History option to see the status of your workflow. You will be able to see the status of each step of the workflow.Click on the workflow name.You will be redirected to a special&amp;nbsp;Document Preview&amp;nbsp;screen. Here you will see the workflow instructions at the top of the screen. On the Navigation Panel, you will see an option for overriding the participant action for that step.Click the override option (i.e., Override: Done, Override: Approve, Override: Reject) if you no longer want to wait for the participant to respond.Click Cancel to close and continue to wait for the participant to take action.If your workflow has more than one step, overriding a step will cause the workflow to progress to the next step.Advanced ConceptsWorkflow Inbox _ Workflow tasks can be managed and acted upon within the workflow inbox. The workflow inbox can be viewed within the Workflows Workspace. See the knowledge article titled&amp;nbsp;Workflows Workspace&amp;nbsp;for information on how to navigate within this workspace.Approval Workflow Templates _ You can create workflow templates which can be used to simplify the creation of approval workflows by storing a set of steps which are frequently used.

        <title>Chained Document Smart Rules</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/chained_document_smart_rules</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?RestrictionsHow is it used?To create a Document Smart Rule that will be part of chainTo create a Document Smart Rule that launches a chain of rulesAdditional ReferencesWhat is it?Smart Rules can be chained together so that rules with different filter conditions and actions can be combined to fire based on a single event. This allows a single event to trigger multiple Smart Rules, expanding what can be done using Smart Rules to allow for complex &quot;nested&quot; filters and action sequences. See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for a general discussion of Smart Rules.When is it used?In a single Smart Rule, you can define a set of actions that impact the scope set within the filter. However, there may be scenarios where you would like a set of actions to be taken based on different filter criteria, or even different actions based on two or more sets of filter conditions. For these more complex scenarios, you can use Chained Smart Rules. For example, if you have three rules, each with a different filter and associated actions to be taken but which share the same trigger, these Smart Rules can be chained together such that a single document event can be used to start all three Smart Rules.Restrictions &amp;amp; UsageThere are some restrictions or limitations to be aware of when determining if chained Document Smart Rules can and should be used. These are:Only Document Smart Rules can be chained (i.e., Scheduled Smart Rules cannot be chained)The actions Bulk Metadata Import and User Sync may not be used in a chained rule.A Document Smart Rule may not call itself in the action Run RuleA single chained Document Smart Rule may be called by more than one Document Smart Rule.Actions in a chained Document Smart Rule will not fire events.Filters are not required for Document Smart Rules with an event type of Chained, but can be specified if desired to provide additional granularity to the set of documents to which the defined actions will apply.How is it used?To create a Document Smart Rule that will be part of chainThe first step in creating a chain of Document Smart Rules will be to define each individual &quot;Chained&quot; rule that will make up the chain. You must be a SpringCM Super Administrator to create a Smart RuleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from within the Account Preferences section of the tree.Select Rule then New Document Rule from the menu bar.Type in a descriptive name for the rule in the Name field (required).Select the Chained event from the Event drop down.Define the User ID that should be used to execute the specified action(s). See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for additional assistance.Define one or more filters to that will determine the document or folder sets on which the actions are to be run. Please note that the filters are not required because the event type is Chained. However, you can specify a filter if you want these actions to apply to a subset of the documents which are to be included in the entire chain. See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for additional assistance.Define one or more actions that will be executed when the chained document Smart Rule is initiated.When you are finished defining your rule, click SaveExpected Results: The rule will be created and added to the rule list as a disabled rule. The rule list will display the name, an event of CHAINED, the filters and the actions that make up the rule.To create a Document Smart Rule that launches a chain of rulesWhen you have finished creating the individual &quot;Chained&quot; Document Smart Rules that will make up the chain, you will create another &quot;Master&quot; Document Smart Rule which will monitor for an event, then call each of the &quot;Chained&quot; rules. You must be a SpringCM Super Administrator to create a Smart RuleSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect Smart Rules from within the Account Preferences section of the tree.Select Rule then New Document Rule from the menu bar.Type in a descriptive name for the rule in the Name field (required).Select the desired document from the Event drop down.Define the User ID that should be used to execute the specified action(s). See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for additional assistance.Define one or more filters to that will determine the document or folder sets on which the actions are to be run. This filter will determine what documents and folders will be considered when the event is fired, and is an important part of the rule. If an additional filter is not specified by one of the Chained Smart Rules, then this filter will apply to the Chained Smart Rule and will define the document set on which the Chained Smart Rule will take action. See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for additional assistance.Define one action for each of the &quot;Chained&quot; Document Smart Rules with an action type of Run Rule selecting the chained rule from the drop down list.Click Add Action to add the action to the action sequence.When you are finished defining your rule, click SaveExpected Results: The rule will be created and added to the rule list as a disabled rule. The rule list will display the name, the event type, the filters and the actions that make up the rule.Additional ReferencesThe following knowledge articles provide additional details which will help you to create and work with Smart Rules:Smart RulesSmart Rules: EventsSmart Rules: FiltersSmart Rules: ActionsSmart Rules: Common Use Cases</content:encoded>

This identifier is provided for each document or Folder that is being synchronized. These overlays provides an indication at the local file system the status of any document and folder that is underneath MySpringCM Files.&amp;nbsp;These overlays are applied to both files and folders.&amp;nbsp;When is it used? &amp;nbsp;Status overlays are used for every object that is contained underneath My SpringCM Files. For documents, the status describes its current state. For Folders, it descibes the state of the contents of the Folder.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?OverlayMeaningCommon ScenariosSynchronized: Document or Folder has been successfully synchronized from SpringCM to the computer. Successful synchronization of new document added&amp;nbsp; in SpringCM Successful synchronization of new document added&amp;nbsp; locally Successful synchronization of new folders added locally or in SpringCM Successful synchronization of updated Documents An entire folder of content has been successfully synchronizedSynchronizing: Document or Folder is in the process of being synchronized from SpringCM to the computer Documents or folders have been recently added and have been identified as needing synchronization A Folder has documents that are in the process of being synchronized. This can happen when all other documents are up to date and new documents have just been added If any document inside a folder is being synchronized the parent folder will show as synchronizing.Conflict: Document or Folder has conflicts There are many scenarios in which a document or folder can be in conflict.&amp;nbsp; Please see conflict resolution Knowledge Article If any document inside a folder has a conflict the parent folder will show with a conflict.Skipped: This document is skipped for synchronization and will not be checked again.

Any document that you have access to which has all of these words in either the body of the document, the document name, the document description, or any of the document attributes will be returned in the basic search hit list.When is it used?&amp;nbsp;A basic search is used when you want a quick way to find your items.&amp;nbsp; A basic search is initiated using the search field in the upper right_hand corner of every SpringCM web page.How is it used?To run a basic word searchLocate the Search Documents field in the upper right_hand corner of any SpringCM web pageType the word(s) that you would like to search on in the Search Documents field. If you type more than one word without quotes, the words will be treated as an AND relationship so that it will find only documents that have all the words (e.g., software contract will find software AND contract).Click the magnifying glass &amp;nbsp;OR press the ENTER key while in the field to initiate the searchExpected Results: The search will execute and return a list of all documents that you have access to which contain ALL of the specified words anywhere within the document contents, the document name, the document description, or any of the attributes.To view search resultsUpon completion of the search, SpringCM will display the Advanced Search page along with the criteria used to conduct the search and a list of documents that contain the specified search criteria.Searching will return a maximum of 100 documents of which you can page through the entire search results as well as change the sort order. &amp;nbsp;If the result is greater than 100 results, then SpringCM will let you know that &quot;Your search returned more results than can be displayed. If the document you are looking for is not in the list below, please refine your search.&quot;If it takes too long to return your results, then SpringCM will let you know that&amp;nbsp;&quot;We've reached the maximum time limit for executing your search. If the document you are looking for is not in the results below, please refine your search.Each document in the document hit list will have a plus sign on the left hand side. You can expand the plus sign to display a snipet of the document showing the text that was found which matched the search criteria.If you would like to find additional occurences of the text, follow the instructions in the knowledge article titled Document Preview and Navigation Panel.To run a basic phrase searchLocate the Search Documents field in the upper right_hand corner of any SpringCM web pageType the phrase that you would like to search on in the Search Documents field enclosing the phrase in quotes (e.g., &quot;software contract&quot;)Click the magnifying glass &amp;nbsp;OR press the ENTER key while in the field to initiate the searchExpected Results: The search will execute and return a list of all documents that you have access to which contains the phrase anywhere within the document contents, the document name, the document description, or any of the attributes.To extend a basic search to foldersWhen the basic search completes it will show the search hit list. By default, it will show only documents because it searched only for documents. However, the search can be easily extended to include folders as well.Run a basic search as instructed above.At the top of the search hit list you will see a section called ContentIn the Content section under Search For, check FoldersNote that the criteria that you entered in the Search Documents field has been copied to the field With All of these Words.Click SearchExpected Results: The search will execute again, and this time will return both a list of documents and a list of folder names which contain the specified words.To extend a basic searchWhen the basic search completes it will show the search hit list. It will also show all of the advanced search options which allow you to specify additional search criteria, or do more targeted searching. You can extend the basic search by adding additional criteria and re_executing the search. Please see the knowledge article titled advanced search for more information.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>ChainingThis will allow Smart Rules to be sequenced explicitly rather than relying on propagating rule events.XPath XPath is a query language for finding information in an XML document.XPath is used to dynamically generate folder structure and metadata versus hard coding.SpringCMs most common types of XPath expressions are:&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;!__[endif]__&amp;gt;Create a folder&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;!__[endif]__&amp;gt;Move to a folder&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;!__[endif]__&amp;gt;Apply metadataIn SpringCM, the following XML fields are what are used most often:&amp;lt;Id&amp;gt;value Id&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Description /&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Name&amp;gt;name of documentName&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;ParentFolderId&amp;gt;valueParentFolderId&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;ParentFolderName&amp;gt;nameParentFolderName&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;CreatedBy&amp;gt;name@springcm.com&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;CreatedDate&amp;gt;2010_09_12T18:52:42.76CreatedDate&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;UpdatedBy&amp;gt;name@springcm.com&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;UpdatedDate&amp;gt;2010_09_12T18:52:42.76UpdatedDate&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;IsFormDocument&amp;gt;falseIsFormDocument&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;EditDocumentURL&amp;gt; URLEditDocumentURL&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;IsCheckedOut&amp;gt;falseIsCheckedOut&amp;gt;Example: XPath expression that creates a folder and moves a documentWhen a document is indexed with a complete status from a specific attribute group, a folder is created and then the document is moved to that location.What this looks like in SpringCM is as followsCreate Folder XPath: /Human Resource and Payroll/Employee Folders/[%/Document/eLearning/EmployeeNumber%]/We have the folder path established and then the XPath begins with [%] where the folder will be named with the value of employee number from the eLearning attribute group.Move Folder XPath:/Human Resource and Payroll/Employee Folders/[%/Document/eLearning/EmployeeNumber%]/</content:encoded>

        <title>Workflows Workspace</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/workflows_workspace</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When it is used?How is it used?To view the workflow inboxTo start an approval workflowTo create or modify an approval workflow templateTo create or edit an advanced workflowWhat is it?The Workflows workspace is the area of the SpringCM web interface where SpringCM users will go to interact with workflows that they are participating in, and to create, activate, and modify Approval Workflows and/or access SpringCM's Advanced Workflow features.When is it used?Any user who participates in a SpringCM workflow of any type will eventually need to visit the Workflows workspace primarily for the purpose of viewing their workflow inbox. The Workflow inbox is where a user will see all of his or her workflow assignments (i.e. tasks) in one central location. The workflow inbox is similar to your email inbox, except that it contains a list of tasks that you are responsible for completing rather than emails. As you take action on the tasks, they will be removed from the inbox, thereby giving you a running list of items that are outstanding and require your attention.Users who have created a workflow and want to monitor the status of that workflow, will visit the Workflows workspace to check the status and to take administrative action on a particular workflow step that will allow them to override a participant or reassign a task.More sophisticated users who want to create workflows will use the Workflow workspace to create Approval Workflows or to launch the Advanced Workflow editor.Finally, SpringCM administrators will use the Workflows workspace when they want to create templates for commonly used approval workflows which can streamline the creation of approval workflows for all users.How is it used?How you use the Workflows workspace depends on what you are trying to accomplish.To view the workflow inboxSelect GOTO then Workflows from the menu bar. This will take you to the Workflows workspace.Once in the Workflows workspace, you will see your Workflow inbox.&amp;nbsp;The inbox will contain a list of all your outstanding tasks. Date fields will tell you when the task was assigned to you and the timeframe during which you are being asked to complete the task (i.e., due date)You can use the paging controls (i.e., page, show) and column sort within the inbox to navigate large tasks lists, but generally your list of tasks should be small if you are taking action in a timely manner.Click on the History action to the right of the workflow to see the status of the workflow.Click on the Workflow name, the Workflow activity, or the assigned to name to take action on the workflow.The task will remain in your inbox until you take action on it, until it expires based on the time frame configured by the workflow creator, or until the workflow administrator takes action on your behalf.To create an approval workflowApproval Workflows are typically started from within a Document workspace, by selecting a document then initiating the approval workflow creation (i.e., Send for Approval). However it is also possible to initiate an Approval Workflow directly from the Workflows workspace.From the Workflows workspace, select START then Approval Workflow from the menu bar. The Create Workflow dialog will appear.Provide a descriptive Name for the workflow.Because you did not start by selecting a document, there will be no documents associated with the workflow. Click Select Documents to associate one or more documents.Complete the steps of the workflow. Review to the knowledge article titled Approval Workflows for additional instructions on how to configure steps.Click Start to initiate the workflow.Expected Results: Because you initiated the workflow, step 1 of the workflow will be immediately added to your workflow inbox as an administration task. Each subsequent step will also appear in your workflow inbox as an administrative task as each step is completed by the participants. You can override each step as necessary to keep the workflow progressing, or let each participant take the action as originally intended. Use the History action to view the status of each step.To create or modify an approval workflow templateTemplates allow you to create reusable workflows which can be used by any user to easily launch approval workflows without the need to configure workflow steps. This ability to choose from a pre_defined set of steps reduces the time necessary to activate an approval workflow. The process of creating an approval workflow template is much like creating an approval workflow itself, with only a few minor exceptions. The basic steps for creating or modifying an approval workflow template are:From the Workflows workspace, select Manage then Approval Templates from the menu bar.A list of all of the defined workflow templates for the current account will appear. An Action drop down to the right of each template name will allow you to work with the existing template:If you want to delete existing template, use the Actions drop down to the right of the template name to select Delete Template, then confirm your deletion. Skip to the end.If you want to modify existing template, use the Actions drop down to the right of the template name to select Edit Template. Skip to step 5.Selecting Use the template is equivalent to selecting START then Approval Workflow from the menu bar as discussed in the previous section.If you want to create a new template, select Templates then Create template from the menu bar, or click Create Template on the toolbar. The Create Workflow dialog will appear.Provide a descriptive Name for the new template.Define the documents, users and steps which are to be part of the template. Review to the knowledge article titled Approval Workflow Templates for detailed instructions on creating a template.Click Save to save the template.Expected Results: The new template will be added to the list of available templates for the account and will be available for any user (full subscriber or above) to use, edit or delete.To create or edit an advanced workflowWhile the approval workflow capabilities discussed above are powerful in and of themselves, they are intended for a very specific business process__the review and approval of documents. As long as you are trying to simply automate the process of reviewing and approving documents, it is likely that the Approval Workflows feature will meet your needs. However, there may be times when you are trying to automate more complex business processes. For these times, the SpringCM Advanced Workflow will be required. See the knowledge article titled Advanced Workflow for more information on what this powerful feature offers.The creation and editing of advanced workflows is initiated from the Workflows Workspace.&amp;nbsp;Select Edit then Advanced Workflows from the menu bar to launch the Advanced Workflow Designer tool.Select Edit then the name of a published advanced workflow to edit a specific workflow.If you have a task in your inbox related to an advanced workflow, you can reassign or unassign task by selecting Manage then either Reassign or Unassign from the menu bar.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/what_is_detailed_logging</link>
        <description>What is Detailed Logging?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is Detailed Logging?Detailed Logging is used to troubleshoot issues should they arise in Business Sync, SpringCM Edit, and SpringCM Scan. &amp;nbsp;Normal logging returns any errors that occur and any key logging actions that occur as the application is running.Detailed Logging provides in_depth logging for every request made to SpringCM and the responses received back from SpringCM. Detailed logging should only be enabled when requested by SpringCM and disabled after capturing the necessary information.&amp;nbsp;Detailed logging is fairly intensive from a disk perspective and may slow down your computer while the app is in this mode. Leaving detailed logging enabled for lengthy periods (most specifically for Sync) may significantly impact free space on your hard drive.&amp;nbsp;How do I enable detailed logging?&amp;nbsp;Enable detailed logging by performing the following steps:For ScanOpen ScanSelect SettingsSelect General SettingsSelect Detailed LoggingFor EditRight click on the Edit Tray and select PreferencesSelect Detailed Logging&amp;nbsp;Select OkFor SyncRight click on the Sync Tray and select PreferencesSelect SettingsSelect PreferencesSelect Detailed LoggingSelect Apply</content:encoded>

        <description>What are Document Save Options</description>
        <content:encoded>What are Document Save OptionsDocument save options allow you to better control how and when documents in your Sync folder that you edit and save are versioned in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;What does create new version do?&amp;nbsp;Create new version on save represents the default beahvior of Sync. In this mode, every time a document is saved, Sync automatically uploads the saved document into SpringCM as a new version of the documentWhat does prompt to confirm do?&amp;nbsp;Prompt to confirm asks if you want to upload the saved copy of a document as a new version in SpringCM. When this mode is set, every time the document is saved, the user is asked if the document should be saved into SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;When this pop up notification is displayed, it does not impede your ability to continue working on the document. &amp;nbsp;If you dont move your mouse over the pop up notification, it will vanish after a short period of time.&amp;nbsp;When you elect to save the document as a new version in SpringCM, simply mouse your mouse over the pop up notification and select Save. You can optionally enter a version comment. Version comments are saved in the history of the document in SpringCM and appear in the description of the document in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;What does remind if idle to checkin or save do?&amp;nbsp;If this setting is enabled, then Sync will check every few minutes or hours ( specified by you) to see if there are documents that have been:saved but not updated in SpringCM (due to prompt on save option)checked out, edited, and not checked back into SpringCMchecked out, not edited and not checked back into SpringCMThese documents can be found in Pending Documents in the Sync Center.&amp;nbsp;If any documents meet this criteria, then a pop up notification will be displayed indicating that documents exist that need your attention.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What are Pending Documents in the Sync Center?</description>
        <content:encoded>What are Pending Documents in the Sync Center?Documents that are found in Pending Documents are documents that require your attention for a variety of reasons. These reasons include:documents that have been edited but not uploaded into SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;Documents that have been opened, modified and not saved to SpringCM.This requires you to enable prompt on save in Document save options. &amp;nbsp;documents that have been checked out, modified but not checked back into SpringCM.documents that have been checked out and not modified.What can you do with documents that are in Pending Documents?&amp;nbsp;You can:select the document which will open the document locally.&amp;nbsp;Enter in any optional version commentsFor Checked out documents, you canCheck the document back into SpringCM and optionally enter version comments.&amp;nbsp;Save the document to SpringCM but keep it checked out. When this occurs, the saved document will be uploaded into SpringCM as the most current version of the document but wll remain checked out.Cancel the checkout of the document. This option is only available if the document has not been modified locally. When this occurs, the original document will be re_downloaded from SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;For edited but not versioned&amp;nbsp;documents, you canSave the document back &amp;nbsp;to SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;This will upload the document with its changes to SpringCM.When are they uploaded after saving or checking in?The document will be uploaded at the first available opportunity. What this means is that if Sync is in the midst of uploading or downloading other documents that need to be synchronized, these actions will be handled first and then any documents you specify from Pending Documents or through the pop ups will be processed after that.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>What are Local Storage Settings? </title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/what_are_local_storage_settings</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?Local storage settings show how many documents are being synchronized between your computer and SpringCM as well as how much storage is being utilized locally.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;You may want to know how many documents have been synchronized between your computer and SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;You may also want to set an age filter. An age filter, if set, will synchronize documents that have been added or edited &amp;nbsp;in the time frame set. If you set remove content after:0 days: then age filtering is not implemented. Any content in the folders synchronized will be synchronized down to the desktop regardless of the age.30 days: then any content that is not been added or changed in the last 30 days will not be synchoronized to your computer. If a document has been synchronized but has not modified in the last 30 days, then it will be removed from your computer but still remain in SpringCM.Any content that is not synchornized to your computer and is outside the age filter will remain in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;How do I get to it?You can get to it by:opening your Sync Preferencesselecting Sync settingsreviewing Local Storage settings. Here you can set an age filter.</content:encoded>

        <title>WebDAV: Troubleshooting and Performance Improvement</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/webdav_troubleshooting_and_performance_improvement</link>
        <description></description>
        <content:encoded>Troubleshooting: Accounts having the same nameThose users who have two accounts with the same name may have difficulty with WebDAV. The default in SpringCM will be the account you will be able to use with WebDAV. If you would like to use both accounts with WebDAV, we recommend the user to rename their accounts to different names.Improvement in PerformanceUsers running Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) can experience even faster connections. Turning off automatic proxy settings detection will improve speed.How to turn off IE8's automatic proxy settings detection:1. Go to Internet Explorer&amp;gt;Tools&amp;gt;Internet Options2. Select the Connections tab.3. Click LAN Settings.4. Uncheck Automatically detect settings.5. Click OK until you are out of the dialog box.</content:encoded>

        <title>WebDAV: Microsoft Office Integration</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/webdav_microsoft_office_integration</link>
        <description>Integration with MS Office</description>
        <content:encoded>Integration with MS OfficeChoose one of the following three ways to open MS Office documents and to access the WebDAV client:&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;!__[endif]__&amp;gt;Double_click the document directly from the shared WebDAV folder.&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;!__[endif]__&amp;gt;From within an MS Office application, select File &amp;gt; Open and browse the folder webdav.springcm.com.&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;!__[endif]__&amp;gt;From within an MS Office application, select File &amp;gt; Open and enter &quot;https://webdav.springcm.com&quot; to access folders and to locate documents.When you open a document via MS Office, it will attempt to check out the document. If the document cannot be checked out because it is in use, you will receive a prompt stating that a read_only version has been opened. When you save a checked_out document and close it, the revision is updated in SpringCM.MS Office Naming Convention/Folder Structure LimitationsMS Office limits the number of characters you can use in the folder path and file names when you transfer documents. If your MS Office documents are stored in a complex folder structure that comprises many characters, you may have difficulty uploading them to SpringCM. If this problem arises, reduce the number of folders and/or truncate document naming conventions. The character length limits vary for each MS Office application as follows:&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Microsoft Word: 254 characters including the file name extension.&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Microsoft PowerPoint: 258 characters including the file name extension.&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Microsoft Access: 258 characters including the file name extension.&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Microsoft Outlook: 258 characters including the file name extension.&amp;lt;!__[if !supportLists]__&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Microsoft Excel: 218 characters including the file name extension.</content:encoded>

        <title>Upload Documents</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/upload_documents</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To add content using the Upload buttonTo add content using drag_and_dropAdditional methods for adding contentAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?There are several methods by which content can be added or uploaded to SpringCM. The appropriate method to use will be determined by your user preference and your use case.When is it used?When you need to add one or more documents or files to SpringCM, identify the upload method that best meets your needs and which you are most comfortable with. This knowledge article will help you to understand the basic upload methods, and present information on all available upload methods so that you can choose what is right for you and your use case.How is it used?The two most common or basic methods that an individual SpringCM user would take to upload content using the SpringCM web client is the Upload button and Drag_and_Drop.To add content using the Upload buttonThe most basic method to upload a document or file to SpringCM is to use the Upload button. Follow these steps to use this method.Select GOTO then Documents from the menu bar.Navigate to the folder to which you want to add the documents or files.Click to select the folder in the folder list or drill into the folder so that it is the current folder on the screen.Select File then Upload from the menu bar, OR click the Upload button on the toolbar.Use the browse dialog to select one or more files from your local computer or network directory.&amp;nbsp;Click Open to enact the upload action.Expected Results: A progress bar will briefly display as each document is uploaded. When the upload is complete, the current folder will refresh and show your newly uploaded document in the SpringCM folder you targeted for the action. If you added content to a sub_folder, open that sub_folder to see the newly uploaded documents.To add content using drag_and_dropRather than using a button to upload content, you may prefer to use a drag_and_drop action. SpringCM also supports the use of drag_and_drop to add content. See Advanced Concepts below for limitations regarding the drag_and_drop method.Select GOTO then Documents from the menu bar.Navigate to the folder to which you want to add the documents or files until it is either the current folder, or until the folder is displayed as a sub_folder on the Browse Documents grid in the SpringCM web client.Click and hold the document(s) you wish to upload from your computer.To upload into the current folder, drag the document(s) over the title bar of the Browse Documents grid (next to the Total Items count), until the grid is select (outlined), and let go.To upload into a sub_folder, drag the document over the sub_folder name in the SpringCM Browse Documents grid, until the subfolder is highlighted, and let go.Expected Results: A progress bar will briefly display as each document is uploaded. When the upload is complete, the current folder will refresh and show your newly uploaded document in the SpringCM folder you targeted for the action. If you added content to a sub_folder, open that sub_folder to see the newly uploaded documents.Additional methods for adding contentThe following are additional methods by which content can be uploaded to SpringCM. They may be used extensively in your SpringCM account, but typically are used for a special purpose or they require installation of a third_party or another SpringCM application to enable the functionality. Click each method to learn more about it.Inbound E_mail _ send an email to a folder in SpringCM using a folder_specific email address to have the email and its attachments added as new content to the folder.&amp;nbsp; This is typically used when receiving content from outside of the organization from persons who are not SpringCM users.Fax _ send a fax to a folder in SpringCM using a folder_specific fax number to have the facsimile added as new content to the folder. This is typically used for receiving content from customers or co_workers with hard copies or without reliable Internet access.Business Sync _ The SpringCM Business Sync application provides background synchronization from a local computer to the SpringCM cloud_repository allowing users to simply save documents and files to a folder on their local computer and it will be automatically uploaded to SpringCM. It requires installation of the SpringCM Business Sync local application. Use this method of upload for ease of use and to minimize training requirements.SpringCM Mobile _ Upload a document to SpringCM using your iOS or Android mobile device after installing the SpringCM mobile application. Use this method on all your mobile devices to facilitate interacting with SpringCM content from the mobile device, including but not limited to uploading new content.Scan to SpringCM bypasses your scanner's software and uploads scanned images directly to your account.Print to SpringCM enables you to upload your documents and other content into SpringCM by simply clicking the &quot;Print&quot; option available in almost all software programs. It is typically used for older, legacy software applications or to save Web pages, PDFs, digital photographs, or other electronic images from applications directly.SFTP&amp;nbsp; _ add content to SpringCM using a third_party SFTP client. This method is typically used when there is a need to upload large numbers of files, and also when you desire to retain a folder hierarchy for the inbound files.WebDAV is designed for easily uploading documents within the Windows Explorer environment. This option retains complex tree_folder hierarchies and includes functionality in Microsoft Office programs.Web services/API enables you to access SpringCM from most outside software programs, including uploading documents.Advanced ConceptsResumable Uploads _ Uploads of large files can be interrupted and restarted. See the knowledge article titled Resumable Uploads for additional information on this feature.Upload Limitations _ The maximum document size and the maximum number of documents which can be uploaded will vary depending on the method by which the document was transferred and based on your SpringCM account type. See the knowledge article titled Upload, Download and Conversion Limits for details.TroubleshootingDrag_and_drop is supported only with HTML 5 enabled browsers (i.e., IE 10+,&amp;nbsp;Mozilla Firefox 14.0+, Safari 5.0+, Chrome&amp;nbsp;17.0+)Only documents, not folders, can be uploaded using drag_and_drop into SpringCMA maximum of 20 files can be uploaded in one drag_and_drop actionShould an upload via drag_and_drop fail, please refresh the browser page and try to upload again.&amp;nbsp;Documents can not be uploaded via drag and drop into Document Lists (Search Results or Recently Accessed Documents)Uploading a folder in Chrome via drag and drop will result in the documents being uploaded into the folder selected. You will also see an item representing the folder that can not be uploaded. When this occurs, you will see a message &quot;Filetype not allowed&quot;&amp;nbsp;You are unable to drag and drop a folder into SpringCM in FireFox.&amp;nbsp;If you have a poor internet connection, please retry when your connection has improved.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>You can set your local time zone to have all SpringCM timestamps and notifications reflect your designated time zone. For example, if you work in New York but your company is based in Chicago, all timestamps for document links, workflows, etc ... will display in Central Time for your fellow team members in Chicago. Likewise, all timestamps related to document links, workflows, etc ... sent or initiated by team members in Chicago will display in Eastern Time within your SpringCM account. The time zone feature ensures that workflow participants don't miss deadlines because they're in different time zones than the workflow initiator.</description>

The types of changes that it looks for are new or updated documents new or updated folders, moved documents and folders, deleted documents, &amp;nbsp;and changed documents.&amp;nbsp;SynchronizingDocuments and folders are being synchronized &amp;nbsp;(uploaded or downloaded) between SpringCM and your computer.Synchronized, All Up to DateThe application has synchronized all documents and folders between SpringCM and the computer.Connection LostThe computer is not connected to the internet or a connection cannot be established with SpringCM for Sync.Conflict ResolutionSync has identified that at least one sync conflict&amp;nbsp;has occurred. &amp;nbsp;When a conflict occurs, Sync waits for the user to resolve any conflicts or close the Conflict Wizard. When the Conflict Wizard is closed, it will check for modifications and &amp;nbsp;if the conflict still exists, will open the Conflict Wizard. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Subscription Count ExceededWhen the maximum numbers of documents have been synchronized down to the desktop, no additional documents will be synchronized until either the number of documents being synchronized is reduced or the subscription count has been increased. &amp;nbsp;From the Accounts tab, you can identify how many documents have been synchronized. To resolve the issue, a number of options exist:1. Unsubscribe to a set of folders thereby removing synchronized documents from the computer. When a folder is unsubscribed, the folder and its documents will be removed from the computer. You can identify how many documents&amp;nbsp;are being synchronized from each folder.&amp;nbsp;2. Reduce the Number of Days that the system is checking for content changes.&amp;nbsp; If the change is made from 30 days to 10 days, then only content added or changed in the last 10 days will be synchronized down to the computer.3. Coordinate with your SpringCM Administor to change the subscription for your Account.The number of documents can vary based on subscription.PausedSync has been paused.&amp;nbsp; No synchronization activities are occurring.&amp;nbsp; Resume synchronization by right clicking on the SpringCM tray icon and selecting resume. if Sync is in the progress of uploading or downloading documents, it may complete these activities.&amp;nbsp;Related articlesSpringCM Sync Conflict ResolutionView Synchronized Folders</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM customers should have three SpringCM accounts:&amp;nbsp;DEV, QA, and PRDDEV (Development)  Developers (workflow or web services) should be Super Administrators in these accounts.&amp;nbsp;QA (Quality Assurance)  Limited to Production Super Administrators&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; Developers should be able to provide packages to be installed in the QA account.PROD (Production)  Limited to Production Super Administrators.&amp;nbsp; The same packages installed in QA will be installed in PROD.Naming Conventions: Workflows, Document Rules, and E_forms should be named according to a standard:&quot;Project  Component&quot;&amp;nbsp;For example, if you have a project called New Item Process, workflows should be named:&quot;New Item Process  Reporting&quot;Which indicates the Reporting component of the New Item Process.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Super Administrators&amp;nbsp;have unlimited access to account resources and settings, and can delete or change content, running workflows, et al.&amp;nbsp; As such, the number of Super Administrators in an account should be limited.Super Administrators should have a separate logins:Administrative UserBusiness/Process UserFor example, Super Administrator John Smith interacts with the system on a regular basis as part of his work, but occasionally needs to perform administrative tasks.&amp;nbsp; Johns daily login for work as a participant in his companys business process could be jsmith@springcm.com, but when he wants to perform administrative tasks, he could login as jsmith.sa@springcm.com.&amp;nbsp; The concept here is very similar to Unix/Linux system administration; you wouldnt normally login to your Unix system as root, and SpringCM Super Administrator credentials should be used only to perform administrative tasks.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?A stop word is a commonly used word (such as &quot;the&quot;) that the SpringCM search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query. When building the index, SpringCM will remove these commonly used words from any index entry. The list of words that are not to be added is called a stop words list. Stop words are deemed irrelevant for searching purposes because they occur frequently in the language. In order to save both space and time, these words are dropped at indexing time and then ignored at search time.When is it Used?Refer to this SpringCM Search Stop Words list when you are troubleshooting issues related to SpringCM Search.How is it Used?The following table identifies the list of commonly used words that are eliminated by the SpringCM search engine because they are deemed to be stop words.

If de_selected, the user will be required to launch the App manually.Keep Logged In:&amp;nbsp;This setting is used to ensure that the user who authorized Scan for use is automatically logged in each time. This setting is used if a single user is performing all of the scanning operations.

        <title>SpringCM Folders</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/springcm_folders</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To create a folderTo edit a folderTo set a start folderTo move or copy a folderTo delete a folderFolder SettingsAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?SpringCM Folders Overview VideoSpringCM folders provide a way for you to organize the documents you store in SpringCM just as you would on&amp;nbsp;your desktop computer. A folder hierarchy of as many sub_folder levels as you require may be created. At SpringCM, we typically refer to this folder hierarchy as the taxonomy.In addition to helping to organize and categorize your documents into an easily navigated folder tree structure or taxonomy, folders can be used to apply security and attributes to documents, and to restrict functionality or features available for documents within the folders.When is it used?As you add content to SpringCM, you can create as many folders as you need to organize or separate documents by department, project, client, team member or however your organization's taxonomy has been established.If your organization is new to SpringCM, and you have not yet established a taxonomy, it is recommended that you give consideration upfront to what the initial taxonomy should look like. You should consider your security requirements in doing so. The SpringCM Professional Services team can assist you in setting up a taxonomy that will meet both your current and future needs.How is it used?To create a folderSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like the new folder added to. If you want to add a folder at the root level, click on your account in the folder tree.Select File then Create then Folder from the menu bar OR click the Create Folder button on the toolbar.Type in a Name for the folder (required).Type in an optional Description for the folder.Click the Save button.&amp;nbsp;Expected Results: The folder will be created as a subfolder of the selected folder, unless you made it a root folder by first selecting your account.To edit a folderSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like to modify.Select Manage then Folder Setting from the menu barMake the desired changes. See the section titled Folder Settings for detailed information on the available options.Click the Save button.To set a start folderWhen an organization has a large folder tree established, it can become cumbersome to continually navigate to the portions of the folder tree that apply to you or that you care about. Set a Start Folder to be automatically directed to a starting place on the folder tree that you most care about.Select GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like to be your start folder.Select View then Set Start Folder from the menu barExpected Results: You will receive confirmation that your start folder setting has been saved. The next time you login, you will be taken to the start folder. You may have only on start folder, so if you change your start folder at any time, the latest selection will be your start folder and any previous selection will be removed.To move or copy a folderYou can relocate an existing folder in your tree. For example, you may create a folder then determine that you created in the wrong place. Additionally, you can create a new folder using an existing folder as a template. This may be helpful to setting up new folder structures for recurring engagements or projects. To move or copy a folder do the following:Select GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like to move or copy.Select File then Move or Copy from the menu barYou will be directed to another page which will list the item selected. It should list the folder name that you desire to move or copy.Click Select to choose a destination to which the folder will be moved or in which the new folder will be created.Use the selection dialog to choose the destination, then click Select to return to the move copy dialog.Click either Move to move the folder to the selected destination OR Copy to create a new folder in the destination.Expected Results: If you selected Move, then the folder will be removed for the original location and added to the destination. If you selected Copy, then the folder, its sub_folder and all of its contents will be copied as a new folder within the destination.To delete a folderSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like to delete.Select File then Delete from the menu barYou will be asked to confirm the delete operation. Confirm the delete by clicking OK.Expected Results: The folder, its sub_folder and all of its contents will be deleted, and you will be redirected to the parent folder if necessary.Folder SettingsAllow Pinpoint on Documents within this Folder _ This setting will determine if the document annotation feature called pinpoints will be available for use on documents within the folder. It is enabled by default on all new folders. See the knowledge article titled Document Annotation Using Pinpoints for more information.Restrict Attribute Groups in this folder _ This setting allows the folder owner to limit what attribute groups can be applied to documents stored in the folder. For example, if you know that the folder will hold only Human Resources documents, then you may want to restrict the attribute groups to only those specific to Human Resources. This will eliminate the number of available attribute groups when setting up sub_folders, which can be helpful if your organization has a large number of attribute groups.When this option is select, the restrictions will not be forced upon existing subfolders. However, after the restrictions are established, all new subfolders created after that point will inherit the initial attributes group restrictions from its parent.After enabling the checkbox to restrict attribute groups, a list of all valid attribute groups will be displayed and you will need to select which attribute groups should be allowed by placing a check mark in front of each desired attribute group.Inbound E_mail Address _ Each SpringCM folder can have an inbound email address assigned to it which will allow content to uploaded to the folder by addressing an email to the folder. See the knowledge article titled Inbound Email for more information.Set Folder as Public _ Marking a folder as public will provide a URL which will allow the folder and all of its subfolders to be viewed without logging in to SpringCM.Advanced ConceptsSecurity _ The folder typically determines the security that will be applied to the documents within the folder. See the knowledge article titled Security for more information on how to set up security on your folders.Folder_based Attribute Defaults _ Default values can be applied to documents as the document is uploaded based on the folder to which the document is added using folder_based attribute defaults. These default document attributes are typically used to minimize user input and to ensure that documents within the folder have a particular attribute value. See the knowledge article titled Default Document Attributes for additional information.&amp;nbsp;Folder_based Notification _ When setting up folders you should also consider if you want to receive notification on activities related to the documents within the folder. See the knowledge article titled Notifications for additional information.Share a link to a folder _ If you have a folder that you want to make available for viewing by another person either inside or outside of your organization, you can do this by sharing a link to the folder. See the knowledge article titled Share Link for more information.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it Used?How to toggle between UAT and ProductionWhat is it?UAT is short for our User Acceptance Testing environment, whereas PROD is short for our Production environment. Our UAT environment is where SpringCM customers test upcoming releases prior to these releases being deployed to production. Customers may have an account in both of these environments for testing upcoming releases. With SpringCM Edit, you have the ability to toggle between these two environments to facilitate this testing.When is it Used?Refer to this knowledge article for instructions on how to toggle between the UAT and the Production environments when you are engaged in testing an upcoming release and are using the SpringCM Edit feature.How to toggle between UAT and Production?If SpringCM Edit was not previously installed: Click Edit next to the document you wish to edit.Follow the prompts to install the applet.On the SpringCM Edit Options window, hold down ctrl + alt + shift and left&amp;nbsp;click on Login (use ctrl +alt +shift on the left side of the keyboard).You can then select between UAT and PROD.Then select&amp;nbsp;Login.If SpringCM Edit is already installed:Right click on the SpringCM Edit icon on the desktop tray.Go to Preferences.Hold down ctrl + alt + shift and left click on Login&amp;nbsp;(use ctrl +alt +shift on the left side of the keyboard).You can then select between UAT and PROD.Then select Login.Alternate MethodThe you prefer, or if the above method does not work for you, you may also change the login email address on login to yourname@domain:uat to get to the UAT environment.</content:encoded>

Using an easy to use interface, you can create on or more Smart Rules to automate tasks and processes to meet a variety of use cases. This knowledge article presents several use cases to demonstrate how Smart Rules can be used to automate tasks and processes. See the knowledge article titled Smart Rules for a general discussion of Smart Rules.Review each of the use cases below to see which one&amp;nbsp; most closely aligns with your needs, then review the sample Smart Rule configuration to for an example of how to setup the Smart Rule(s) to accomplish the tasks associated with the use case.Alternatively, if you know the type of Smart Rule that you need, use the samples provided here to help you define your own Smart Rules.Use Case: Employee On_boardingEmployee on_boarding documents are mailed to an inbound SpringCM folder. The Human Resources Clerk monitors this folder for inbound documents, and tags the documents with an EmployeeID , an attribute within the attribute group titled Employees. From here the document is to be automatically moved to a folder where all the on_boarding documents for this employee will be stored.Sample Smart Rule Configuration: Assign Attribute GroupObjective: Setup a Smart Rule that assigns an attribute group to a document when it arrives in the inbound folder so that it can be reviewed and categorized by the Human Resources Clerk.Name:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Apply Employee Attribute GroupEvent:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Document Entered FolderExecute As:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specific UserFilter(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Folder /Account/Employees/InboundAction(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign Attribute Group w/attribute group=EmployeesExpected Results: When the document arrives in the inbound folder, the Attribute group Employees will be assigned, such that when the document is reviewed the EmployeeID can be entered.Sample Smart Rule Configuration: Move DocumentObjective: Setup a Smart Rule that monitors documents in the inbound folder for an attribute change on the employeeID, and when employeeID is provided move the document to an employee specific folder.Name: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Move Document to Employee folderEvent:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Document IndexedExecute as: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specific UserFilter(s): &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Folder /Account/Employees/InboundAction(s): &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Create Folder&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; w/path=/Employees/[%Document/Employees/EmployeeID/Text()%]/&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {AND}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Move Document&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; w/path=/Employees/[%Document/Employees/EmployeeID/Text()%]/Note: The value for the path within Actions utilizes an XPath value. See our knowledge article on XPaths for more information. Expected Results: The change of the attribute value EmployeeID will trigger the document to be indexed. Upon indexing, the Smart Rule will fire. If an employee folder does not exist, the Smart Rule will create one. The document will be moved to the employee folder.Use Case: Customer Inquiry TrackingA company has a link on their website to a public SpringCM eform which is used to intake inquires from potential customers. The inquiries will be added to a folder called Customer Inquiries. New items will be assigned a Stage of NEW, indicating that one of the Customer Rep should contact the customer. Once the customer is contacted, the Stage will be set to IN PROCESS. When it is closed the Stage is set to CLOSED. A SpringCM Dashboard is used monitor new inbound inquiries, and highlight inquiries that have been open more than two weeks based on a datetime attribute in the same attribute group.Sample Smart Rule Configuration: Assign Attribute ValuesObjective: Setup a Smart Rule that assigns an attribute group and attribute values of Stage and DateInitiated to an inquiry when it is first created in the Customer Inquiries folder.Name:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign Inquiry StatusEvent:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Document AddedExecute As:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specific UserFilter(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Folder /Account/Customer Inquiries/Action(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign Attribute Group w/attribute group=InquiryResponse&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {AND}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign Attribute Value w/value Stage = NEW&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {AND}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assign Attribute Value w/value DateInitiated = [$Today$]Expected Results: When the eForm is completed and submitted, a new inquiry (eForm document) is created in the Customer Inquiries folder. It will be assigned the attribute group InquiryResponse. The Attribute value for Stage will be set to NEW and the DateInitiated will be set to todays date.Sample Smart Rule Configuration: Move DocumentObjective: Setup a smart rule that moves the documents in a sub_folder based on the status.Name: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Move Document to status subfolderEvent:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Document IndexedExecute as: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specific UserFilter(s): &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Folder /Account/Customer Inquiries/Action(s): &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Move Document&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; w/path=/Customer Inquiries/[%Document/InquiryResponse/Status/Text()%]/Expected Results: When the status is changed on the document, it will trigger a document index. When the document is indexed, the document will be moved to the appropriate sub_folder: New, In Process, Closed.Use Case: Using a Smart Rule to Start a WorkflowA company uses SpringCM with Salesforce. They want to make sure that if an NDA is on file for a customer it will be stored in the SpringCM folder associated with the Salesforce Account. They have created an Advanced Workflow that looks for documents that may be misfiled, and moves them to the Account folder.Sample Smart Rule Configuration: Start WorkflowObjective: Create a Smart Rule to trigger a previously defined Advanced Workflow when a document is added via Salesforce.Name: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Refile NDAEvent:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Document AddedExecute As:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Specified UserFilter(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Subfolder /Account/SFDC/Accounts/&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {AND}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Has Name Like w/value=NDA&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {OR}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Has Name Like w/value=Non Disclosure&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {OR}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Has Name Like w/value=Non_DisclosureAction(s):&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Start Workflow w/value={advanced workflow name}Expected Results: When a document is imported to any Salesforce Account, Opportunity or other account object with NDA, or Non Disclosure, or Non_Disclosure in its name, it will trigger the advanced workflow which will take the necessary actions to move the document if it requires moving.Use Case: Chained Smart RulesAn automated process generates daily accounting reports that are uploaded to a SpringCM folder.

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/share_link</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To share a document or folder as a private linkTo share a document or folder as a public linkSend a link using your default email applicationAdvanced OptionsWhat is it?The Share Link feature provides a great way for content stored in SpringCM to be shared with others, without the content leaving the secure environment of the SpringCM cloud. This is beneficial because once documents are physically attached to emails, they are no longer easily managed and no longer secured by SpringCM. By emailing links to the content, the content can stay under the management of SpringCM.Content can be shared with another user in your SpringCM account in the form of a private link, or it can be shared with users who do not have a SpringCM account in the form of a public link (URL). When sharing content publicly, there are additional options which control how and when the content can be downloaded via this public link. This options provide a method to ensure your content is consumed only when and how you want it to be consumed.When is it used?Use the Share Link feature whenever you want to share content stored in SpringCM rather than sending the content as an attachment to an email.Share as a private link if you want to invite users in your SpringCM account to review or engage in revising the content.Share as a public link if you want to make the link available to users who do not typically login or do not have a user login for your SpringCM account. (e.g.., send a public link to an agreement stored in SpringCM to a vendor you are working with for review)How is it used?To share a document or folder as a private linkSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder and/or document you want to shareCheck the folder or document that you want to shareSelect Send then Share Link from the menu bar, OR click the Share Link button on the toolbarYou will be taken to the Share a Link window.&amp;nbsp;Select Use the Private Link Click Send to continueComplete the email screenClick Send a second time to send an email with the link to the email recipients.To share a document or folder as a public linkThis functionality can be disabled at the account level. See Advanced Concepts for information on how to enable/disable public link capabilities.Select GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder to shareCheck the folder that you want to share.Select Send then Share Link from the menu bar, OR click the Share Link button on the toolbarYou will be taken to the Share a Link window.&amp;nbsp;Select Make a Public LinkCheck Allow Downloads if you want the recipient to be able to download documents in their native format from the folder.Check Allow PDF Downloads if you want the recipient to be able to download documents in PDF from the folder.Specify a date when the public link to the folder will expire (it will default to 1 month out)Click Send to continueComplete the email screenClick Send a second time to send an email with the link to the email recipients.Expected Results: An email will be sent to the email recipients with a link to the folder. The folder icon will change from gold to blue, and will have a link on it to provide visual indication that the folder is shared with a public link.To send a link using your default email applicationBy default, the email will be sent via SpringCM. This typically works well for private links, because all of the recipients for the private link will also be users in the SpringCM address book. However, for a public link, your recipient may not be in the SpringCM address book (even as a contact), and you may prefer to send the email from your default email application (i.e..., Microsoft Word, Lotus Notes, etc.). To use your default email applicationSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder and/or document you want to shareCheck the folder or document that you want to shareSelect Send then Share Link from the menu bar, OR click the Share Link button on the toolbarYou will be taken to the Share a Link window.&amp;nbsp;Choose the type of link you want to send (i.e.., private or public), and complete any additional options presented.Click Send to continueClicking Open in my EmailA new email window will be launched in your default email application, and the link will be copied to the body of the open message. Complete the message and select any recipients you want to send to. Please note that if you are sending a private link, that only those recipients who have a SpringCM User login will be able to see the link.Complete the operation by clicking send from within your default email application.To manage shared linksPreviously created links can be viewed, edited and deleted.&amp;nbsp; Super Administrators can view and delete all shared links in an account (but cannot edit a shared link someone else has created). All links can be deleted even after it's been sent out and used (previewed or downloaded) by someone else.&amp;nbsp;Select GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder and/or document you want to shareCheck the folder or document that you want to shareSelect Send then Share Link from the menu bar, OR click the Share Link button on the toolbarIf you created a public link that is still active, it will notify you and allow you to update the active link.Click on the pencil next to the active link to edit the properties of the active link.Click on the red X next to the active link to delete it.Click on the Active Links tab to see all links that are currently active for the content.If you are Super Admin, you can delete any of the active links on the Active Links tab by clicking on the red X next to the link. This does not delete the content itself. Rather, it will disable public access to the content referenced by the public URL.Advanced ConceptsEnabling Public Links in your accountThe ability to share public links to folders and documents is enabled by default for any SpringCM accounts created after September 2013.&amp;nbsp; If the account was created before&amp;nbsp;September 2013, then this may be disabled on the account.&amp;nbsp; To check, enable/disable, and manage this feature on the account the User or Super&amp;nbsp;Administrators may do the following:Select GOTO then Preferences from the menu barNavigate to Account Preferences portion of the preference category listClick on the&amp;nbsp; Security category underneath Account PreferencesLocate the section title &quot;Share&quot;Check the Allow Public Folders option to allow users with the specified access rights to publicly share a folder with individuals that are not members of your SpringCM account.By default, only those who have View, Edit, Delete &amp;amp; Set Access on a folder can share a public link. Specify the minimum security privileges that the user must meet in order to to share a folder. Check the Allow Public Documents option to allow users with the specified access rights to publicly share a document with individuals that are not members of your SpringCM account.By default, only those who have View, Edit, Delete &amp;amp; Set Access on a document can share a public link. Specify the minimum security privileges that the user must meet in order to to share a documentClick the Save button to enable the preference.Expected Results: Users with the specified rights may not created public folders and public documents that will be available to individuals who are not members of the SpringCM account using a public URL. If you are disabling public folders or documents, it will delete all existing public links, so you will be asked to confirm that you want to disable the feature.Reusing a public linkOnce the public link has been created, the URL for that link can be reused. It will remain active as long as the link has not expired or been deleted. For example, you may want to place a link to a public document or folder on your website. Do do this, simply copy the URL for the link&amp;nbsp; and paste it into your web page or anywhere else you want to use it.Report of Publicly Shared LinksIf public links are enabled in your SpringCM account, it is a recommended best practice that the Super Administrators periodically monitor for content that is shared via a public link. To facilitate the monitoring of public links, SpringCM provides a standard report that will show you all publicly shared folders and documents, by user and date.&amp;nbsp; Access this report on the Reports tab. The report name is Public Documents and Folders.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?The Sync Folder is the root folder where all synchronized content between SpringCM and your computer resides. &amp;nbsp;Documents can not be added to the root of the Sync Folder. &amp;nbsp;New Folders added underneath the root of the account are automatically added to SpringCM and your Sync folder.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Every time a new document or folder is synchronized between SpringCM and your computer. &amp;nbsp;From the sync folder, you cansend links to documents or foldersset or view attributes associated to a documentcheck out a document &amp;nbsp;and either check in or cancel the check out.&amp;nbsp;How to change it?&amp;nbsp;In Sync 2.5 or newer, the first time you setup Sync, you will be asked to set the Sync Folder. It can be set at any time during completion of the setup wizard &amp;nbsp;and can be changed at any time after that.To change the Sync Folder, perform the following steps:Open up your Sync preferencesSelect SyncSelect Move from SpringCM Folder Location.Choose a folder that is not empty.&amp;nbsp;The Sync client will move all content to the new location.&amp;nbsp;Considerations:The Sync Folder needs to be an empty folder on your computer.&amp;nbsp;The Sync Folder can not be on a networks share.&amp;nbsp;If you are on a windows workstation, then you will need to consider the maximum number of characters that will be utilized in defining a document at the lowest level. &amp;nbsp;Windows currently limits the number of characters that can be used in defining the path to a document to 250 characters. &amp;nbsp;For example if your Sync folder is C:\Documents and Settings\jtsmith\Documents\My SpringCM Documents, then you are already using 65 characters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Send for External Review</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/send_for_external_review</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?Overview of how to use SpringCM External ReviewThe SpringCM Send for External Review feature provides an easy way for you to collaborate with your external customers, vendors and partners to share, capture feedback, and redline important documents with third parties, without using e_mail attachments.When is it used?There are other methods by which SpringCM documents can be sent for review. These methods are discussed in detail in the knowledge article titled Send Documents.The Send for External Review feature is intended for a specific use case where there is an expectation that an internal party and an external party will be collaborating on the content a document, each party needing to either provide feedback (comments), or to make revisions to the specific document.Use the Send for External Review feature when you are collaborating on a document with someone who does not have access to your SpringCM account _ this external party would never need to login to SpringCM for this event.One example... if you are negotiating a contract with a customer and the master version of the contract is stored in SpringCM, the customer will probably not have the ability to login to view and edit the contract directly. However, when you are finished with your edits, send the contract to the customer using the Send for External Review feature, and the customer will have the ability to make their desired changes, and then version the document without logging in. The master version of the contract will remain in SpringCM, and the document history will reflect the external edits made by the customer.How is it used?The process begins with a simple interface for sending the document to an external party for review. While the document is out for review, it is automatically locked in SpringCM to prevent editing of the document. The external party will receive an email from the sender with a link to start the review.&amp;nbsp; The external party will click on the link and be taken to a secured page to begin his review.&amp;nbsp; The external party viewing this page will be able to either add comments to the document preview, or download and edit the document, and upload a new version of the document to the secured page.&amp;nbsp; Step 1: Internal party sends document for external reviewSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder containing the document that you want to send for external review, and place a checkmark in front of the document. You may select only one document.Select Send then For External Review from the menu barSelect a recipient for the External Review action _ this would be the email for the external party you wish to collaborate with.Enter a Due Date _ this is the length of time the external party will have to respond by. Enter an Email Subject _ this is what the external party will see when they receive the email from SpringCMEnter an Email Message _ this is the detail you can provide the external party on what document you have linked them to, and what is expected with their action.You will have the option to Preview the Message _ providing a windoid preview of what the external party will see from you. You can click the X on the upper right of the windoid to close the preview.Click the Send button.Expected Results: Within SpringCM, users will now see that the document has been locked with a padlock icon displayed next to the document type icon in the document list. Hovering over the padlock will show who has the document locked for External Review. The document history will be updated with an action Checkout (External Review). An email has now been sent to the external party with the message and link to a secured page for completion of their review action. Step 2: External party receives link, provides feedback/comments or makes changes to the documentThe external party recipient will receive the email from SpringCM, with your message detail and link to the secured page for their review action. The external party will be given an introductory message to Start Review, explaining they have the option to comment or redline the document linked to them.Clicking Start Review will display the document preview on the right side of the page, along with the action panel on the left side of the page.&amp;nbsp; The external party will see the option to &quot;Give Your Feedback&quot; or &quot;Upload an Edited Version&quot; of the document. Once their updates are made, the external party will click &quot;Complete Review&quot;Expected Results: The external party that has now completed their review will continue to have access to the the secured page through the expiration period of the link (which is the Due Date selected in step 1).&amp;nbsp; They will also receive notification of the processes completion via email.&amp;nbsp;Step 3: SpringCM receives and processes the returned documentWith the Complete Review step selected by the external party, SpringCM will check_in the document, removing the padlock icon from the browse documents display within SpringCM.&amp;nbsp; Both the SpringCM sender user, as well as the external party recipient, will receive an email advising the completion of this event.&amp;nbsp; The history of the document involved will show all actions related to the steps above.&amp;nbsp; </content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/set_default_scanner_default_upload_folder_and_default_attribute_group</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?Setting these defaults enables the user to more easily scan documents and upload them quickly into SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;These defaults are used by Scan in processing documents added to be sent to SpringCM. If you are using a Scanner, the default Scanner must be setup. The default folder and default attribute group are optional and can be set or changed when uploading a document.&amp;nbsp;Steps to completeSelect&amp;nbsp;PreferencesSelect GeneralSet Default Scanner:&amp;nbsp;Select from the list of connected scanners the one that you want to select as the default. This is the scanner that will be used for every scan operation. If you need to change it for a one time scan, then you will need to change it back to the default upon completion. This is a required step.&amp;nbsp;Set Default Folder:&amp;nbsp;Navigate to the upload folder that you want Scan to use in each upload activity. This can be overriden for each upload but this represents the default folder that will be utilized.&amp;nbsp;This is an optional step.&amp;nbsp;Set Default Attribute Group: Select the attribute group that you want Scan to use in each upload activity. The list of Attribute Groups that will be displayed are the ones that have been configured in each SpringCM Account. This can be overriden for each upload but this represents the default attribute group that will be utilized. Only one attribute group can be the default. &amp;nbsp;This is an optional step.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

Please see the knowledge article titled Saved Searches and Search Defaults for more information.Number of Search ResultsUpon completion of the search, SpringCM will display the Advanced Search page along with the criteria used to conduct the search and a list of documents that contain the specified search criteria.Searching will return a maximum of 100 documents of which you can page through the entire search results as well as change the sort order. &amp;nbsp;If the result is greater than 100 results, then SpringCM will let you know that &quot;Your search returned more results than can be displayed. If the document you are looking for is not in the list below, please refine your search.&quot;If it takes too long to return your results, then SpringCM will let you know that&amp;nbsp;&quot;We've reached the maximum time limit for executing your search. If the document you are looking for is not in the results below, please refine your search.Elements of the Search ResultsUpon the completion of any search, basic or advanced, the search hit list will be displayed on the search results page. The search results page has several collapsible sections. Knowing the purpose of each schedule will help you to navigate the page:Content: The content section allows the user to enter and display search criteria that will be applied to multiple content areas (i.e., document contents, document properties, and document attributes). It also allows the user set the search scope (i.e., include folders, limit to a folder, etc.)Properties: The Properties section allows the user to enter and display search criteria that will be applied to a search a specific document property.Attributes: The Attributes section allows the user to enter and display search criteria that will be applied only to document attributesAttribute Group: The Attribute Group section will only be displayed if the Attribute Group was selected in the Attributes Section. The Attributes Groups section allows the user to enter and display search criteria that will be applied only to a specific attribute within a specific attribute group.Search and Clear Buttons: Used to execute the search based on the criteria entered above in the Content, Properties and Attributes sections, or to clear that criteria.Folders: This section will only appear if the search scope defined in the Content section included Folders. It contains a list of all folders that matched the search criteria (to which the current user has access). It will list the Name, Description and Last Modified Date. From this list, you can use the checkbox to select a folder then take actions on it use the actions area of the folder list, the menu bar, the tool bar, or the context menu.Documents: The document section will only appear if the search scope defined in the Content section included Documents. It contains a list of all documents that matched the search criteria (to which the current user has access). It will list a search score, the number of hits, the type of document, the document name, the document description, the file size, the last modified date, and the folder name in which the document exists.&amp;nbsp; From this list, you can use the checkbox to select a folder then take actions on it use the actions area of the folder list, the menu bar, the tool bar, or the context menu. Key elements of the Document List are discussed further below:Search Score: The search score provides the user with an indication of the relevance of the document relative to the search criteria entered. It factors in the frequency of the search terms relative to other search terms, other content areas, the totality of the document, and the full document collection. A higher score indicates that it is of higher relevance. By default, document name and attributes are weighted more heavily for determining relevance than is the document contents and description. Your SpringCM Administrator has the ability to influence the relevancy score by adjusting the weights.Hits: The number of hits indicates the number of times that the search terms appear within the document contents. Document properties and attributes are not included in the hit count. If your search hits always report as 0, this suggests that your SpringCM Administrator has disabled this feature.Content Snippet: Next to each document is a plus sign (+) that allows the user to expand the document list to include a snippet of the document contents to see where and how the search term is used. The default size of the snippet is 4 hits of 80 characters. Snippet size can be increased by the SpringCM Administrator.&amp;nbsp;Troubleshooting SearchesHere are some tips to consider when you are performing searches and not getting the results that you expect.When a new document is uploaded to SpringCM, it will be added to a queue of documents which are to be indexed so that it can be searched using a full_text search. Therefore, a newly uploaded document may not be immediately returned in a search. The larger the document the longer the time it will take before the document is available for full_text indexing. If your document is not returning as expected, wait 5_10 minutes and try your search again.Some documents may not return in a full_text search because the document was unable to be indexed at all due to corruption of the original document prior to upload or because the original document is password protected and cannot be opened for indexing.Some document may not return in a full_text search because the original document was of poor quality. This is most likely to occur with images or scanned documents where the content could not be properly OCRed resulting in missing search terms in the index.Please note that all search engines, including SpringCM, utilize a list of words called stop words that are not indexed. If you are attempting to search on a stop word, you may not get the results you expect. Please refer to the knowledge article titled SpringCM Search Stop Words for details.If you feel that you are getting more hits that you expect, this may be a result of stemming. The SpringCM search engine performs stemming by default when providing results so that a search on something like apples will not exclude documents that contain only the singular form apple, or vice versa. You can tell SpringCM to not employ stemming for a specific word by enclosing that word in double quotes ( &quot; ). See the search tips above in the sections titled Basic Search and Advanced Search for examples of how to search without stemming.&amp;nbsp;Non_English Language and Localization Search SupportWhen performing searches for non_English language text please note that support for searches within the various content areas (i.e., document contents, document properties, and attributes), will vary by the type of language. The table below outlines what you can expect when searching on non_English strings.Language TypeExamplesContentsPropertiesAttributesSingle_byte languages with left to right orientationGermanFrenchSpanishYesYesYesSingle_byte languages with right_to_left orientationHebrewArabicYesNoNoDouble_byte languagesChineseThaiKoreanYesNoNoWhen performing numeric and date searches in locales outside of the United States, please note that SpringCM does not automatically convert times/dates &amp;amp; currencies to reflect the users particular locale. Therefore, when searching on numbers and dates, the following formats must be applied.TypeCharacter or FormatDecimal.Comma,DateMM/DD/YYYY</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To execute a saved searchTo specify personal basic or advanced search defaultsTo create a saved searchTo modify a saved searchAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?A SpringCM Saved Search is simply a set a of search criteria that has been saved in advance to provide easy execution of frequently performed searches or to set personal or account defaults for searches that differ from SpringCM defaults.When is it used?Use a saved search for any search that is more complex in nature or which is used frequently in your organization for finding content. For example, if your organization uses SpringCM for contract management, you may want to define a saved search that is configured to look through all your contracts and to identify the ones that are about to expire, a task that you will want to do frequently.You should also use one or more saved searches when you need to tailor the search defaults for your organization to make them better fit your particular search needs and taxonomy.How is it used?To execute a saved searchSelect GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchUse the left_hand navigation panel to see a list of the available saved searches. All users will be able to see the names of all saved searches.Click on the saved search you want to executeExpected Results: The search will execute and display the search results list along with the criteria used to conduct the search on the Advanced Search page. Only documents to which the user has access will be returned in the results list. That is, while all users can see all saved searches, the documents returned will be governed by the user's permissions to view the file.To specify personal basic or advanced search defaultsA user who is the minimum of a Full Subscriber can setup personal search defaults based on a Saved Search using the following technique:Select GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchUse the left_hand navigation panel to see a list of the available saved searches. All users will be able to see the names of all saved searches.Click on the saved search you want to use as a defaultSelect Saved Searches then either Default Basic Search or Default Advanced Search from the menu bar.Expected Results: When the user executes a basic search or brings up the advanced search dialog it will apply the defaults specified in the saved search. If the Run Immediately option was enabled in the saved search, then it will also immediately execute the saved search when the user completes the basic search.To create a saved searchOnly Super and User Administrators can create saved searches.Select GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchEnter the desired search criteria. See the knowledge article titled Advanced Search for details on defining the search.Select Saved Searches then Save As from the menu bar.&amp;nbsp;On the Save Search dialog, enter a name in the Name field.Leave the Run Immediately check box selected if you want SpringCM to execute this search immediately after it is selected.Click the Save button.Expected Results: The new saved search will be created and will be displayed in the left_hand navigation panel of the Advanced Search TabTo modify a saved searchOnly Super and User Administrators can modify saved searches.Select GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchClick the saved search located in the left_hand Navigation Panel that you want to modifyMake the desired modifications to the search criteria. See the knowledge article titled Advanced Search for details on defining the search.Select Saved Searches then Save Search from the menu bar.Note: If you would prefer to save the modifications as a new saved search, Select Saved Searches then Save as from the menu bar.Enter a new name in the Name field if you desire to rename the saved search or if you are creating a new saved search based on the original.Leave the Run Immediately check box selected if you want SpringCM to execute this search immediately after it is selected.Click the Save button.Advanced ConceptsSetting up a Saved Search for Default Basic SearchSelect GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchEnter the desired search criteria.In the field where you want the text from the Basic Search Documents field to be copied to, place the string $Search$ exactly as shown hereSelect Saved Searches then Save As from the menu bar.&amp;nbsp;On the Save Search dialog, enter a name in the Name field. Suggested name Default Basic Search.Leave the Run Immediately check box checked. If you uncheck this, it will not automatically run the search when the user enters the basic search string.Click the Save button.Setting up a Saved Search for Default Advanced SearchSelect GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchEnter the desired advanced search criteria.Select Saved Searches then Save As from the menu bar.&amp;nbsp;On the Save Search dialog, enter a name in the Name field. Suggested name Default Advanced Search.Uncheck the Run Immediately check box. By unchecking this the criteria will be displayed as defaults on the advanced search page, but allows the user to edit or add to it then press Search to execute the search.Click the Save button.To specify account basic or advanced search defaultsA Super or User Administrator can setup account search defaults using the following technique:Select GOTO then Search from the menu bar to go to Advanced SearchUse the left_hand navigation panel to see a list of the available saved searches. All users will be able to see the names of all saved searches.Click on the saved search you want to use as a defaultSelect Saved Searches then either Default Basic Search for Account or Default Advanced Search for Account from the menu bar.Default Precedence _ If a user selects a personal default basic search or personal default advanced search, it will override any settings for default basic search for the account and the default advanced search for the account that may have been set by the account administrators.</content:encoded>

        <title>OAuth Authorization Process</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/oauth_authorization_process</link>
        <description>The authorization process is a one_time setup that grants the application access to SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;The authorization process uses a standard called OAuth (Open Standard for Authorization) to complete the process.&amp;nbsp;</description>
        <content:encoded>The authorization process is a one_time setup that grants the application access to SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;The authorization process uses a standard called OAuth (Open Standard for Authorization) to complete the process.&amp;nbsp;OAuth allows users to share their private resources (e.g. photos, videos, contact lists) stored on one site with another site or application without having to hand out their credentials, typically supplying username and password tokens instead. Each token grants access to a specific site (e.g., a video editing site) for specific resources (e.g., just videos from a specific album) and for a defined duration (e.g., the next 2 hours). This allows a user to grant access to their information stored with another service provider, without sharing their access permissions or the full extent of their data. in the case of Business Sync, the user is granting the Business Sync application access to SpringCM and its content.The steps to complete this process include:From the Business Sync Application, enter the email address that is used to access SpringCMSelect Login and/or Authorize.&amp;nbsp;When the SpringCM login dialogue presents itself, enter the same email that email address that you entered in the Business Sync Client and enter your password.&amp;nbsp;After succesfully entering your credentials and logging in, you are afforded the option to authorize Business Sync access to SpringCM and its content.Select Approve completes the one authorization process.&amp;nbsp;Once authorized, the application communicates with the server and through the use of tokens keeps the Business sync application communicating with SpringCM. There are a couple different types of tokens that are provided.Authorization Code: An authorization code is a short_lived token representing the user's access grant, created by the authorization server and passed to the client application via the browser. The client application sends the authorization code to the authorization server to obtain an access token and, optionally, a refresh token.Access Token: The access token is used by the client to make authenticated requests on behalf of the end user. It has a longer lifetime than the authorization code, typically on the order of minutes or hours. When the access token expires, attempts to use it will fail, and a new access token must be obtained via a refresh token.Refresh Token: The refresh token may have an indefinite lifetime, persisting until explicitly revoked by the end_user. The client application can store the refresh token, using it to periodically obtain fresh access tokens, but should be careful to protect it against unauthorized access, since, like a password, it can be repeatedly used to gain access to the resource server.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is is used?To enable notification on a single folderTo enable notification on all foldersAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?Feature Overview VideoSpringCM provides a robust notification engine that alerts users to events that occur on documents and in the folders they are contained in.&amp;nbsp; Notifications are sent via email and/or made available on the menu bar using a notification counter:Email Notification: You can receive real_time individual emails for each event or consolidate the alerts into a single daily digest delivered by an email summarizing all actions the last 24 hours. The default delivery method is real_time individual emails.Notification Counter:&amp;nbsp; As notifications occur, a number will appear in the header of the page next to the search field indicating the number of new notifications. &amp;nbsp;When a user clicks on the counter, a list of all notifications will be displayed. Clicking on a notification will take a user to the specific document or folder that appeared in the notification. The notification counter is enabled by default.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Use notifications whenever you want to be alerted to activity on a document or folder. You can determine the set of folders or documents for which you want to receive notification. The following events will trigger notification:Document Added

CommentedHow is it used?To enable notification on a single folderSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder for which you want to enable notificationCheck the checkbox next to the folder nameSelect Manage then Enable Notification from the menu bar. (Note: Selecting this on a folder which already has notification enabled will disable notification)Expected Results: You will see a message indicating that notification has been enabled on the folder. When any of the events noted above in the section titled When is it used? occur for the folder or a document within the folder you will receive a notification.To enable notification on all foldersSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect My Preferences then Notification Preferences from the treeCheck the option By default, enable notification on all folders&amp;nbsp;Scroll down until you see the Save button, and click SaveExpected Results: When any of the events noted above in the section titled When is it used? occur for any folder that you have access to or any document within any folder that you have access to you will receive a notification.Advanced ConceptsConfiguring the delivery method: You can configure how you want to receive notification for each of the events noted above in the section titled When is it used?. Do this from the My Preferences, Notification Preferences page. You must select at least one method of notification.&amp;nbsp; The available delivery methods are Send Notification (i.e., the notification counter), Send Email (i.e., real_time), and Send Daily Digest&amp;nbsp; (i.e., once a day summary email).&amp;nbsp;Account Level Enabling: The SpringCM Super Administrator can enable notification on all folders by default using an account level setting. The setting is on the Account Preferences General page in the section titled Notification Settings. This account level setting will only act as a default, such that if the individual user elects to disable notification it will override the account level setting.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Inbound Email</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/inbound_email</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To setup an inbound e_mail address on a folderTo receive an email with attachmentsTo see related attachmentsTo delete an inbound e_mail addressWhat is it?An inbound e_mail address can be assigned to any folder in SpringCM. When someone emails this address, the email and its attachments will show up in the folder associated with that email address. The text of the email will appear as a TXT document in the folder, and the attachments will appear as separate documents in their native format (i.e., the format that they were in when attached to the email). The documents will be related to each other using the SpringCM related documents feature.When is it used?Use an inbound email address on a SpringCM folder to allow anyone who knows the email address to upload content directly to the SpringCM folder without having to login and take an explicit upload action. This feature works well when the sender is not a user within your SpringCM account because it allows them to add content without logging in. Some common examples of when this feature would be used include:Capturing client interactions (requests, communications, etc.) in client specific foldersGeneral or vendor_specific accounts payable or accounts receivable document exchangeCapture of human resources documents as part of hiring and on_boarding activities (resumes, references, employee files, etc.)Capture of RFP and RFI documents in support of your sales organizationArchiving of Public Relations responses or requestsHow is it used?To setup a new inbound e_mail address on a folderSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like to modify.Select Manage then Folder Setting from the menu barScroll down on the Folder Setting dialog until you see the Inbound Email field. See the knowledge article titled SpringCM Folders if you need additional assistance.Click the Save button.Type in a unique e_mail address that describes the folder. You will need to provide portion of the email address that appears before the @ symbol. The domain name will be the same for all SpringCM email addresses and is displayed for you. The email address must be unique across all SpringCM accounts. It is considered best practice to include some sort of organizational identifier in the portion of the configurable email address screen.Click Save to save the email address in the folder settings.Expected Results: If the email address was unique, it will be assigned to the folder. The assigned email address will be displayed at the top of the folder contents list as shown in the figure below. The folder icon in the folder tree will change to a folder with a grey arrow on it to visually signify that the folder has an inbound email address configured.To receive an email with attachmentsThe figure above provides an example of what an email with attachments will look like when it arrives in the inbound folder.Email: The email header and message will be saved in a text document (e.g., *.TXT) and will look like the following. Note that it will list the names of any attachments that were part of the original email.From: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Lastname, Firstname [flastname@springcm.com]To: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;InvoicesDemo@inboundna11.springcm.comCc: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Subject: &amp;nbsp; Inbound Invoice Demo SubjectThis is the email bodyATTACHMENTS:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Invoice 0004 _ SpringCM.pdfAttachment(s): Each attachment will appear as a separate document in the folder. It will be of the same document type as the original document when it was attached to the email.Upon arrival the email and its attachments will be indexed so that they can be found via a SpringCM basic or advanced search.To see related attachmentsThe email text document and the attachments will be related using the SpringCM related documents feature. This will provide a way for you to easily connect the email to the attachment documents by doing the following:From the document list, click on the email text document to go into Preview modeExpand the Document Preview Navigation Panel Scroll down until you see the Related Documents option (you may need to expand the Information section)Click Related Documents to expand a list of all the documents which are related to the email document.From this list you can click on any of the attachments to quickly preview the attachment.Note: SpringCM document relationships are bi_directional. That is, if document A is related to document B, then document B is also related to document A. Therefore, you can navigate to the email from the attachment or the attachment to the email as described in these steps.To delete an inbound e_mail addressSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to OR place a check mark in front of a single folder name that you would like to modify.Select Manage then Folder Setting from the menu barScroll down on the Folder Setting dialog until you see the Inbound Email field. Delete the text in the field.Click the Save button.Note: if you remove and/or retire an inbound email address, please make sure to notify any party who may be using that address and remove any public references to that email address (e.g., email links on your website, in job descriptions, etc.)</content:encoded>

        <description>Ignorable Sync ConflictsPrior to the 2.5 Sync release whenever a conflict of any kind occurred the user was prompted to resolve the conflict. This included conflicts that were not caused by the particular user.</description>
        <content:encoded>Ignorable Sync ConflictsPrior to the 2.5 Sync release whenever a conflict of any kind occurred the user was prompted to resolve the conflict. This included conflicts that were not caused by the particular user.As an example, I may be synchronizing a Marketing folder and duplicate documents were uploaded by members of the marketing team. Prior to this release, I would receive a conflict that required the name of the document to change but I could not make the change. This conflict would continue to interrupt the sync process until resolved.&amp;nbsp;This release of Sync is smarter and will not stop the sync process when these conflicts occur. It will notify the user that a document or folder could not be synchronized and will continue to synchronize other content.&amp;nbsp; When this occurs, a notification will be presented to the user in the Notification Center.&amp;nbsp;When an ignorable conflict is resolved, the document or folder is synchronized to the computer. A notification is not communicated to the user.&amp;nbsp;Ignorable ConflictsDescriptionWhat happensDuplicate Document&amp;nbsp;Multiple documents with the same name exist in the current folder in SpringCM.Document will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the document is not synchronizedIf using Sync, the user that uploaded the document or last modified it &amp;nbsp;will get a sync conflict.&amp;nbsp;Duplicate FolderMultiple folders with the same name exist in the current folder in SpringCM.Folder and its content will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the folder is not synchronizedIf using Sync, the user that created the folder or last modified it &amp;nbsp;will get a sync conflict.&amp;nbsp;Path Too LongThe path to the document locally is too long for the document to Sync to the computer. In this case the document or folder would not be synchronized.&amp;nbsp;Document or folder will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the document or folder is not synchronizedBecause users may sync to different Sync locations, this may or may not cause a conflict for the last modified user.&amp;nbsp;Contains invalid CharactersA document or folder contains invalid characters that are not supported by Windows, the least common denominator. &amp;nbsp;(\ / : * ? &quot; &amp;lt; &amp;gt; )&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Document or folder will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the document or folder is not synchronizedIf using Sync, the user that created the folder or last modified it &amp;nbsp;will get a sync conflict.Starts or Ends with a Space or Ends with a PeriodA document or folder &amp;nbsp;starts with a space or ends with a space or period.&amp;nbsp;Document or folder will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the document or folder is not synchronizedIf using Sync, the user that created the folder or last modified it &amp;nbsp;will get a sync conflict.Is a Reserved NameA document or folder &amp;nbsp;is named after a reserved Windows Name.&amp;nbsp;Document or folder will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the document or folder is not synchronizedIf using Sync, the user that created the folder or last modified it &amp;nbsp;will get a sync conflict.Blank NameA document or folder does not have a name. &amp;nbsp;Document or folder will not sync for subscribers of the folderUser will be alerted that the document or folder is not synchronizedIf using Sync, the user that created the folder or last modified it &amp;nbsp;will get a sync conflict.</content:encoded>

        <title>How to scan a document using SpringCM Scan</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/how_to_scan_a_document_using_springcm_scan</link>
        <description>What can be configured for each Scanner?&amp;nbsp;</description>
        <content:encoded>What can be configured for each Scanner?&amp;nbsp;What is it?The SpringCM Scan Scanner Preferences Page provides an overview of Scanners that are connected to the local computer and their configurations. &amp;nbsp;The Scanner Preference Page displays only scanners that are connected to the computer or the default scanner. If a scanner is no longer connected to the computer and is not the default scanner, it will not display in the list. &amp;nbsp;If the default scanner is not connected, it will display but show as disconnected.When is it used?&amp;nbsp;The Scanner preference page is used to set the initial configuration for each scanner or in the case when a specific scanning run requires different scanning options to be set.Configured scanner settings are used everytime a scan is completed.&amp;nbsp;Pre_requisite configurationsThe Scanner must:be connected to the computer via USB or visible on the network to the computer.must have a WIA or TWAIN driver availablemust have a WIA or TWAIN driver installed and configured locally.&amp;nbsp;Once the Scanner has been properly installed locally, the Scanner must be setup in SpringCM Scan. This set of steps boils down to:the Scanner must be set as the default Scanner for the Account that you are scanning into.&amp;nbsp;the default resolution should be set dependent on if an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) or a Flatbed exists (or both)the ADF Page sie must be set (if an ADF is available)the Color must be setthe Mode must be setScanning StepsTo properly complete a scan, perform the following steps:Place the page ont the Flatbed or place the page(s) in the Automatic Document FeederClick on the Start Scan button in the Scan Panel.&amp;nbsp;If a default upload Folder is not set, then SpringCM Scan will ask you to set an upload folder.Optionally, you can change the default after the scan has completed.&amp;nbsp;As the Scan is in process, a pop up message will display.It will start with page 0 as it initializesIt will then iterate through the balance of pages that are in the Automatic Document Feeder&amp;nbsp;You may also see it attempt to scan a page that does not exist. This is part of how it handles detecting if a page is on the feeder.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/how_to_organize_and_manipulate_scanned_pages</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?Scanned or image documents can be manipulated prior to upload to SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;This allows users to ensure that documents have the right set of pages that are ordered correctly and have the right orientation.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;Prior to uploading any scanned or image document to SpringCM, the operator should review the documents and its page to ensure that the pages are oriented correctly and that each document accurately represents the pages contained within it.The user can interact with the document by clearing all documents, splitting the document into discrete documents, or removing the selected Document.The user can interact with the pages associated to a document through rotating actions, flip actions, and page removal actions.&amp;nbsp;Available ActionsDocument ActionsSplitSelect a page or multiple pages from the preview panel and select Split. This action will take the pages selected and create a new document with these pages in it. These pages will be removed from the original document and the new document will be named uniquely.&amp;nbsp;Split: Enter Pages to SplitWith this action, you can split out a document into multiple documents by performing the following stepsSelect Enter Pages to SplitEnter the pages that you want to add to a specific document in the following format (Page Number, Page Number _ Page Number)1,2,5,91_5,8_102_5Repeat for each document that you want to createA page can only be used once. It can not be created in multiple documents.&amp;nbsp;ClearClear will remove all documents in the Documents Panel. Once cleared, this action can not be undone.&amp;nbsp;Remove DocumentRemove will remove the selected document from the Document Panel. Once removed, this action can not be undone.&amp;nbsp;Page ActionsRotate RightThis will rotate the page(s) selected by 90 degrees to the right. Multiple pages can be selected.&amp;nbsp;Rotate LeftThis will rotate the page(s) selected by 90 degrees to the left. Multiple pages can be selected.&amp;nbsp;Rotate 180This will rotate the page(s) selected by 180 degrees. Multiple pages can be selected.&amp;nbsp;Flip HorizontalThis will mirror the image to the standing axis (interchange the left and right parts of the image.)Flip VerticalThis will mirror the image to the horizational axis (turn the image upside down.)Remove PagesThis will remove the page(s) from the Document. Once done, this can not be undone.UpThis will move to the previous page in the Document.DownThis will move th next page in the Document.ZoomThis slider enables you to Zoom In and Out on the preview panel.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/globally_unique_object_identifiers_guids</link>
        <description>Beginning with SpringCM Version 5.7 in July 2010, Objects (Documents, Folders, Users, and Groups) will no longer be identified by a numeric value but will instead be identified by a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). Prior versions of SpringCM's web services interface accepted and returned numeric values as object identifiers, but in the new interface, web services will accept a string for the Object ID parameter and return strings as object identifiers.&amp;nbsp;This change is necessary for the long_term scalability of the SpringCM service.</description>
        <content:encoded>Beginning with SpringCM Version 5.7 in July 2010, Objects (Documents, Folders, Users, and Groups) will no longer be identified by a numeric value but will instead be identified by a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). Prior versions of SpringCM's web services interface accepted and returned numeric values as object identifiers, but in the new interface, web services will accept a string for the Object ID parameter and return strings as object identifiers.&amp;nbsp;This change is necessary for the long_term scalability of the SpringCM service.&amp;nbsp;Due to this change, the old (v1) web services interface will be deprecated in favor of the new (v2) interface. Both the v1 and v2 interfaces are currently available in SpringCM and will remain available until the July 2010. Existing web services applications will continue to function normally while applications are migrated to the new interface. However, the v1 interface will no longer be available after the July 2010 release of SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;All web services applications must be migrated to the v2 interface by that time.&amp;nbsp;SpringCM strongly encourages customers with web service_based applications to migrate to the new (v2) interfaces as quickly as possible. In the vast majority of cases the work involved in the migration will be a simple matter of pointing the application at the WSDL for the V2 interface and recompiling the application.&amp;nbsp;In some cases the application itself will require minor changes but the basic structure of the applications should remain intact.&amp;nbsp;The documentation for the v2 interface can be found here:https://www.springcm.com/atlas/webservices/v2/SpringCMService.asmx&amp;nbsp;The WSDL for the v2 interfaces can be found here:https://www.springcm.com/atlas/webservices/v2/SpringCMService.asmx?wsdl&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;GUID FAQ&amp;nbsp;What will the GUID will look like?Here is a sample GUID:&amp;nbsp; a0d86399_fe56_df11_bcda_001cc448e3c6More information on GUIDs can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_IdentifierWill the GUIDs be embedded in the UI via URL like the current DOCID?Yes.&amp;nbsp; But the UID will be in the lduid parameter instead of the ldid parameter.&amp;nbsp; Below is a sample URL:https://www.springcm.com/atlas/Documents/Preview.aspx?ldUid=a0d86399_fe56_df11_bcda_001cc448e3c6Will the legacy DOCID in the URL still retrieve the old docs (the note below is a webservice answer)?Yes.&amp;nbsp; For documents that are in the system prior to July 17th, the documents will be accessible by the legacy document ID in the ldid query string parameter.&amp;nbsp; For example, a document uploaded on May 1st may have a document ID of 1234567890.It will be accessible viahttps://www.springcm.com/atlas/Documents/Preview.aspx?ldid=1234567890,  as well as its new UID parameter, https://www.springcm.com/atlas/Documents/Preview.aspx?ldUid=bf3fe5f7_4baf_4f47_b561_bf7959891e60Note however that new documents uploaded after July 17th will no longer receive a numeric ID, only the GUID identifier.&amp;nbsp;If you have questions or require assistance with the transition to GUIDs, please contact SpringCM Support at Support@SpringCM.com or 877.362.7273.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How to create an Include RuleConsiderationsRequirementsWhat does the user see?&amp;nbsp;What is it?Include rules are rules that are administered by the SpringCM Account administrator that automatically synchronize a folder and its documents to the local computer for users who use Sync. This allows the Administrator to pre_subscribe one or more folders.&amp;nbsp;A folder based include rule can be assigned to All Users in the SpringCM Account or to a specific SpringCM Security Group.Examples include the following:Onboarding FolderLatest Company PresentationsLatest Marketing BrochuresHuman Resources Benefit FormsWhen documents in the &quot;include&quot; folder are updated, changed, or removed by the content owners, &amp;nbsp;these changes will be automatically reflected locally.Documents in Include Folders that are not subscribed are not editable or movable. &amp;nbsp;If the user has permission and subscribes to a Mandatory Folder, then these documents are editable.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;When the Administrator, in working with the business, has determined the folders and &amp;nbsp;the groups to have content automatically synchronized, then these rules will get created. These rules only apply to content synchronized via the Sync Application.&amp;nbsp;How to create an Include Rule?Login to SpringCM as the Account AdministratorSelect PreferencesSelect Sync Preferences: Sync RulesSelect Add Include RuleSelect Rule Type of Attribute Value RuleSet the Security LevelAll Users:&amp;nbsp;Selecting All Users will apply this rules to all users in the organization, regardless of SpringCm Role or security groups assigned.Security Group:&amp;nbsp;Selecting Security Group will allow to the user to enter a security group to which the rule should apply. Only one rule can be defined for a given security group.&amp;nbsp;Select a Folder or set of Folders to be synchronized. An Include Rule only includes the specific folder selected. Subfolders need to also be explicitly subscribed if required.&amp;nbsp;Confirm the Selections.Select SaveAdd new rules as appropriate.&amp;nbsp;ConsiderationsThese rules only apply to syncing content locally using the Sync ApplicationFolder Rules applied at the Account Level will apply to all users in the AccountFolder Rules applied at the Security Group Level will be applied to all members of the AccountOnly one rule can be applied to the AccountOnly one role can be applied for a specific Security Group level.Multiple Folders can be assigned to a ruleSubfolders are not automatically added with an Include Rule. All folders that need to be synchronized automatically need to be explicitly added to the ruleDocuments that are in an include folder are read only. If a user attempts to modify a document in an Include Rule and is not subscribed, then a conflict will be returned.&amp;nbsp;Documents in an include folder can not be deleted. &amp;nbsp;The document will be redownloaded automatically by SyncIf an include folder is subscribed and the user has permission to add, delete, edit documents, then the user will be able to do so locally. These changes will be reflected in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;Requirements&amp;nbsp;This feature is included as part of an Enterprise Account or must be purchased separately.&amp;nbsp;What does the user see?&amp;nbsp;When navigating the folder tree, the end user will see an asterisk for each folder for which content will be automatically synchronized down to the desktop. &amp;nbsp;Users can not add documents to the folder, remove documents from the folder, or edit documents in the folder if the folder is not subscribed.&amp;nbsp;If the folder is subscribed and the user does not have permissions set in SpringCM to perform any of these functions, then the user will not be able to make changes to the documents.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Dynamic Case Management</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/dynamic_case_management</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?How is it used?What is it?Dynamic Case Management provides an easy, powerful way to help your staff respond to service requests in common business Cases such as employee on_boarding and marketing collateral review. By using several tools available in the Preferences workspace, you can use Dynamic Case Management to:Eliminate spreadsheet tracking and complex processes with a simple Case Management Checklist.Add tasks, update statuses, add documents to tasks, and assign tasks to staff and customers with drag_and_drop.Check if a Case is progressing on time by referencing a simple color_coded status bar.Cut time searching for email and faxed documents by limiting results to content assigned directly to a Case or task.Integrate Dynamic Case Management with SalesForce.com, SharePoint Web Portals, and SAP.To allow members of your organization to participate in Cases in ways that best suit their job roles, SpringCM offers several Case Management roles:Case Administrators  With full control over a Case, including the ability to create and update tasks and eForms, the Case Administrator role is designed for the manager of the Case.Case Workers  With the ability to modify,&amp;nbsp;reassign, and complete their tasks__as well as permission to upload documents to Cases__a Case Worker is the main user in an active Case.Viewers  With no ability to alter Cases but full insight into their progress, the Viewer is best suited to team members who need insight into a Case's progressHow is it used?Creating a Case involves several SpringCM steps:Part 1 _ Creating a &quot;Case&quot; Attribute GroupPart 2 _ Creating an eForm for Case DetailsPart 3 _ Adding the Case widget to your DashboardPart 4 _ Create&amp;nbsp;the case and tasks&amp;nbsp;for the case&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You can also copy or delete cases, and use Case Smart Rules to automate Case actionsPart 1: Creating a &quot;Case&quot;&amp;nbsp;Attribute GroupAttribute groups provide a method to describe your content by adding specific values to Cases that ensure quick retrieval and proper classification while driving your business rules.For Dynamic Case Management purposes, the Attribute group will contain the properties for the Case. For example, if you use Dynamic Case Management for employee on_boarding, you are likely to have an Attribute group called Employee Information. Inside the Attribute group, you'll add Attribute fields such as First Name&quot;, &quot;Last Name, Date Hired, &quot;Department,&quot;&amp;nbsp;etc.Part 2: Creating an eForm for Case DetailsAn eForm&amp;nbsp;is used to display the Case Attributes that you created in Part 1.&amp;nbsp; It is used&amp;nbsp;to provide Case Workers with the information they'll need to complete their tasks. Case Administrators can add and modify the fields on the eForm while the Case is in progress.&amp;nbsp; In this example, you'll create an eForm using the Employee Information Attribute group created in Part 1.Steps for creating&amp;nbsp;the case&amp;nbsp;eForm:Click the Forms tab.Open the Form menu and select Create.Click the Case View checkbox located at the top of the form.Enter a Name that reflects the function of the form.&amp;nbsp; For example _ Employee Onboarding Case eForm.Click the Show Attribute Group checkbox.Expand the Attribute group you created in Part 1 and click the appropriate Attribute checkboxes you would like displayed on the form.Click the Generate Sample Form link and click the OK button.Click Save.Part 3: Add the Cases Widget for Your DashboardTo access cases, you will need to add a Cases widget to your Dashboard workspace.&amp;nbsp; This widget will display Cases you recently worked on, as well as allow you to search for Case and create new Cases.To add a Cases widget:Navigate to the Dashboard workspace.Click Dashboard in the menu bar.&amp;nbsp; Select Add Widget.Select the Cases widget.Click Save.Part 4: Creating a Case and a Case ChecklistWhen you first create a case, you will need to hit the Create Case option from the Dashboard widget you added (in Part 3).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As a best practice, we recommend that you first create a &quot;Case Template&quot; case _ which will allow you to setup all the Tasks _ or the &quot;Checklist&quot; _ just once (for&amp;nbsp;every case template needed).&amp;nbsp; Once this is saved, you can simply copy new cases from the &quot;Case Template&quot;, and all the the tasks will follow it.&amp;nbsp;You can also create a Case manually Case without any tasks. Tasks can be added as required.To copy a case (i.e. a Case Template case):In the Dashboard tab, click on the name of the case you want to copy.Once the case is displayed, in the menu bar, click CASE __&amp;gt; Copy Case as New Case.Name the new case and click SAVE.To delete a case, read our&amp;nbsp;Delete a Case knowledge article.&amp;nbsp;Case Smart RulesIf your Dynamic Case Management solution can benefit from Smart Rules, please read the Smart Rules knowledge article.&amp;nbsp; You can create Case Rules to automate events when a case has been updated, or when task status has changed.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Dynamic Attribute Dropdowns</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/dynamic_attribute_dropdowns</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?Dynamic Attribute Dropdowns are drop down attribute fields within an attribute group where the valid values presented in the drop down are dynamically generated from a specified object, rather than from a static list of values. It allows the user to select from dynamically generated lists of values, users, documents, and folders.This knowledge article assumes that you are already familiar with attribute groups. If you are are not familiar with attribute groups refer first to our knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups. Only SpringCM Super Administrators can setup Dynamic Attribute Dropdown.When is it used?Use Dynamic Attribute Dropdowns in an attribute group any time you want to validate attribute values against a list, but the list of valid values will change frequently or need to be generated or &quot;looked up&quot; based on another object.&amp;nbsp; Using Dynamic Attribute Dropdowns will ensure that the attributes applied to documents are valid, but eliminates the need for the SpringCM Super Administrator to maintain lists of valid values.For example, assume that there is an attribute group titled Customers and in this group there is an attribute called Customer Name. Each document will be given assigned Customer Name, which we would like to be validated to ensure consistent data entry. However, the list of customer names is growing all the time and maintaining this list would be difficult for the SpringCM Super Administrator. Using a Dynamic Attribute Dropdown, the customer names for the drop down can be derived dynamically from a file which is updated nightly with a data download from the CRM system, thereby eliminating the need for the SpringCM Super Administrator to maintain a static list.By ensuring that only valid values can be entered, document search results will be much more accurate and it makes data entry of attributes much easier for the end user.How is it used?Begin by creating your attribute group as instructed in the knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups.When you are ready to define your Dynamic Dropdown Attribute, Click the&amp;nbsp; +Field button to add a new field to the attribute field list.Enter a Name for the field.Select Dynamic Drop Down from the Data Type selector dropdown list. A text entry box will appear below the attribute field name.Populate the text entry box with the correct syntax for the object which will be used to determine the values. Use the table shown in the section titled Syntax for Dynamic Dropdowns. Please note that the element in the syntax are pipe_delimited with no spaces between elements and the pipe.Set the appropriate attribute field control options. If you would like the end users to be able to enter more than one value, check the Repeatable option for the set (as opposed to the individual attribute fields within the set).Select Save to save the attribute group.Test the attribute group by applying it to a document in document preview, and make sure that the values are displayed as expected based on the object and the syntax.Syntax for Dynamic DropdownsAttribute Value Source ofValuesWhat to enter in text box(i.e., Syntax)DefinitionDocument NameFolderdocument|/rootfolder/parentfolder/folderDisplays the names of documents within the folder named.

        <title>Duplicate Handling</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/duplicate_handling</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?&amp;nbsp;How is it used?To enable/disable duplicate handlingExpected behavior when duplicates are allowedExpected behavior when duplicates are not allowedRules for renaming duplicate documentsDuplicate handling with FTP, SFTP, and WebDav uploadsWhat is it?The SpringCM Duplicate Handling feature is used to specify if duplicate document and folder names can be created within the same node of your SpringCM taxonomy (i.e., folder tree).When is it used?Use this account preference to allow or disallow duplicate document and folder names.SpringCM recommends setting the preference to Duplicate Not Allowed so as to ensure document uniqueness and to minimize any conflicts that can occur if using SpringCM Business Sync as a means of accessing content locally.How is it used?To enable/disable duplicate document handlingNew SpringCM accounts created after December 2013 will have duplicate handling enabled by default such that duplicate document and folder names are not allowed within a folder. Accounts created prior to the December 2013 release will maintain their configured account preferences setting for Duplicate Handling. If switching from Duplicates Allowed to Duplicates Not Allowed, only new document and folder names will be reviewed to ensure uniqueness. SpringCM will not analyze your repository at the time of making the change and with not rename offending items. That is, your repository will remain as is.To enable and disable duplicate handling perform the following tasks:Login to SpringCM as an administratorSelect GOTO then Preferences from the menu barSelect the General node of the Account Preferences tree.Scroll down to the section titled Duplicate HandlingToggle between Duplicates Not Allowed and Duplicates Allowed as appropriateExpected behavior when duplicates are allowedWhen Duplicates are Allowed, &amp;nbsp;SpringCM will allow users to:create documents of the same name in the same parent folder.&amp;nbsp;rename existing documents to documents of the same name in the same parent foldermove documents of the same name to the same parent foldercreate folders of the same name in the same parent folder.&amp;nbsp;rename existing folders to folders of the same name in the same parent foldermove folders of the same name to the same parent folderIf you created the document or folder and are using SpringCM Business Sync, then you will receive a conflict.&amp;nbsp;If someone else created the document or folder and are syncing this folder, then the content will not be synchronized to your desktop and you will receive a notification.&amp;nbsp;Expected behavior when duplicates are not allowedWhen a document is added to or moved into a folder and duplicates are not allowed, SpringCM checks to see if the document name is unique. If the document name is unique, the document is added to the repository without change. However, if the document name is not unique, the document will be renamed. This includes all of the following situations:You will be prevented from creating a folder of the same name in the same parent folder.&amp;nbsp;You will be prevented from renaming an existing folder to a name that is already in use in the same parent folderYou will be prevented from moving a folder to a parent folder if there is already a folder with the same name in the same parent folderIf an inbound email or attachment is duplicated, the documents will automatically be renamed.If a document is created, moved, copied, or renamed via web services and a duplicate exists, then the create action will be successful and the document will automatically be renamed.If during the execution of a workflow step, a duplicate document name is detected, the output xml will contain the modified document description and the document will be renamed. Workflow actions in which this will be analyzed:Document CheckinDocument CreateDocument Copy or MoveDocument RenameeForm Copy or MoveeForm RenameLink CreateLink Copy or MoveLink RenameIf during the creation or submission of an Eform, &amp;nbsp;a duplicate document name is detected,&amp;nbsp;the Eform will automatically be renamed.If during the submission of an Eform, an attachment that results in a duplicate name occurs, the attachment will automatically be renamed.If inbound faxes are duplicated, the fax will automatically be renamed.If an Attribute Naming Template exists and duplicates are not allowed then,The document name is calculated whenever the document is indexed.When the result of the Attribute Naming Template matches an existing document name, then the document will be renamed according to the rules (see below)If, as a result of indexing, a document is no longer a duplicate, then the number will be dropped.The email message as a result of sending a document back from External Review will automatically be renamed if a duplicate name is identified.&amp;nbsp;If a duplicate results due to a Merge as PDF action, the resultant document will be automatically renamed.&amp;nbsp;When a document is split, SpringCM suggests a unique document name. If the suggestion results in a duplicate name, then when the document is created, it wil be renamedWhen a document is renamed, SpringCM will write a history action that indicates that the document was renamed and what its original document name was.&amp;nbsp;Rules for renaming documentsWhen a duplicate document name is detected and duplicates are not allowed, the document will be renamed. The following rules will be applied when renaming documents:The document name is appended with a number.If subsequent document names are added with the same name, the number is incremented.If a gap exists in the increment, then when the document is renamed, SpringCM will fill in the gap. For example if Contract (1).docx and Contract (3).docx exists and a new document Contract.docx is added to the folder, the document will be renamed to Contract (2).docx.For example, if Contract.docx exists in a folder and a new document with the same name is added, then the new document will be renamed to Contract (1).docx.&amp;nbsp; If Contract.docx is again added to the same folder, it will then be renamed to Contract (2).docx.Duplicate handling with FTP, SFTP, and WebDav uploadsIf a document of the same name is uploaded via FTP, the document is deleted and then re_added as a new document.&amp;nbsp;If a document of the same name is uploaded via SFTP, then the document is checked out and then checked in as a new version.If a document of the same name is uploaded via WebDav, then the document is checked out and then checked in as a new version.</content:encoded>

        <title>Download Documents</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/download_documents</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To Download a documentTo Download a document as PDF with or without commentsAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?The Download feature allows the SpringCM user to obtain a copy of a document that is stored in SpringCM by downloading it to the user's local machine. The related Download as PDF and Download with Comments features will perform a conversion of the document to PDF format prior to download such that the copy obtained by the user will be in PDF format. In all cases, the copy of the document stored in SpringCM will remain intact in its native file format.When is it used?The Download feature can be used whenever the user has a need to obtain a copy of the document in its native format. A common use case would be if the user was going to be remote without access to the internet, and wanted to have a copy of the document locally for reference. Another common use of the Download feature is to obtain a copy of the document for editing when using the Check Out feature.The Download as PDF feature can be used as a quick method to obtain a PDF rendition of the document, and is particularly useful if the user does not have an associated application for the selected document type on their local machine that will allow them to open the document.The Download with Comments feature is used when the user wants to obtain a PDF rendition of the document which also contains any annotations/comments that been applied to the document using the SpringCM annotation or Pinpoint collaboration feature.How is it used?The ability to download documents is determined by the user's security access to the document. Assuming the user has download rights to the document, they can use the Download feature to obtain a copy of the document, even if the document is locked or checked out by another user.To Download a documentClick the Documents tab and navigate to the folder containing the desired documentSelect the desired document by clicking its check box in the document list, OR click on the document to open it in Preview Mode.Select File then Download from the menu bar, OR click the Download button located on the toolbar.You will receive a pop_up dialog from your browser asking if you want to open or save the document. Select Open to both download and open the document in its associated application or Save to select a location on your local computer where the document should be downloaded to. Click OK to complete the operation. (Note: this step may vary depending on your browser type and version)Expected Results: If you chose the Open option, the document will be downloaded in its native format to the default download directory for your browser and opened in the application associated with this document type. If you chose Save and selected another location, the document will be added to the save location but not opened.To Download a document as PDF with or without commentsClick the Documents tab and navigate to the folder containing the desired documentSelect the desired document by clicking its check box in the document list, OR click on the document to open it in Preview Mode. (Note: the Download with Comments feature is only available in Preview Mode)Select File then Download as PDF or Download with Comments&amp;nbsp; from the menu bar.You will receive a pop_up dialog from your browser asking if you want to open or save a PDF rendition of the document. Note that the document has already been converted to PDF format.Select Open to both download and open the document in the application setup on your machine for opening PDF documents, or select Save to select a location on your local computer where the PDF document should be downloaded to. Click OK to complete the operation. (Note: this step may vary depending on your browser type and version)Expected Results: If you chose the Open option, the PDF rendition of the document will be opened your PDF viewer. If you chose Save and selected another location, the document will be added to the save location but not opened. If you selected Download with Comments, the PDF rendition of the document will contain a reference number where each comment was located in the original document, and a table at the end of the document with the text of the comment associated with that reference number.Advanced ConceptsHistory/Audit Trail _ Every time a document is downloaded the action is recorded in the document history. One of two actions will be logged__either Download Document Native or Download Document PDF. This will indicate which download option was selected by the user.Download Limitations _ The maximum document size and the maximum number of documents which can be downloadede will vary depending on the method by which the document was transferred and based on your SpringCM account type. See the knowledge article titled Upload, Download and Conversion Limits for details.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/document_rules_notify_web_service</link>
        <description>On the Document Rules configuration page, there is an action available called Notify Web Service.&amp;nbsp;This can be used to notify an external application of events, such as versions added or metadata changed.</description>
        <content:encoded>On the Document Rules configuration page, there is an action available called Notify Web Service.&amp;nbsp;This can be used to notify an external application of events, such as versions added or metadata changed.ImplementationThe action will accept one parameter  the URL to the web service. For example:http://external.customer.site/WebServices/EventHandlerService.asmx&amp;nbsp;The specified web service must implement the OnDocumentRuleEvent* method from the WSDL as defined by this service:&amp;nbsp;https://www.springcm.com/atlas/webservices/v2/SpringCMEventService.asmx&amp;nbsp;The above service, although running, is only a template one. It does not implement any of its methods. Its only purpose is for clients to generate the WSDL and implement it in their own environments.The web service method will be called asynchronously  the call will be made, and the rule service will not wait for it to complete or check for any type of outcome.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Technical DetailsThis is the signature of the web service call:&amp;nbsp;OnDocumentRuleEvent(CustomRuleEventType eventType,int accountId,long ruleId,string ruleName,long documentId,string documentPath)&amp;nbsp;Implementers should generate a class and extend it.&amp;nbsp;In .NET, the wsdl.exe utility can be used like so:&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;wsdl.exe /serverInterface https://www.springcm.com/atlas/webservices/SpringCMEventService.asmx&amp;nbsp;This will create SpringCMEventServiceInterfaces.cs which should be extended and the method implemented.&amp;nbsp;*July 2010 ReleaseEffective with the July 2010 release, the signature of the method we will invoke changes to:&amp;nbsp;OnDocumentRuleEvent_v2(CustomRuleEventType eventType,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;string accountId,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;string ruleName,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;string documentId,&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;string documentPath)&amp;nbsp;Our current best practice is to implement both methods to ensure a seamless transition to the July 2010 release.&amp;nbsp;See the GUID knowledge article for more information.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?&amp;nbsp;What is it?With the&amp;nbsp;Document Builder, you can quickly and easily build perfect business documents. The Document Builder will guide you through the process of building documents (such as a contract, SOW, or proposal) via a wizard to select the appropriate clauses, terms, etc.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, information from Salesforce.com can be automatically mapped and merged into your business document. Document Builder can export files both as a PDF or in MS Word format. &amp;nbsp;The default format is PDF export.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Using Document Builder results in business documents that follow corporate standards, reduce risk, and dramatically shorten approval cycles.&amp;nbsp; Visit our&amp;nbsp;Document Generation Webpage&amp;nbsp;for a more detailed description. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Document Builder provides the following features:Create wizards for assembling documentsExtract and manipulate data from any SalesForce.com objectPrompt for user_inputted dataSupport for many field types, including:&amp;nbsp; Text, Date, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, Picklists, etc.Field validation and input masksMerge extracted and inputted data into MS Word and PDF templatesBundle multiple documents into a single document. This could be a simple as creating an NDA or a complex as putting together an entire proposal that comprises multiple documentsAssociate created documents with the appropriate SalesForce.com objectKick off an Approval Workflow when completedPDF417 (2D) Barcodes&amp;nbsp;The Document Builder wizard is made up of three sections:Available Documents: This is where you will select the documents you want to create or include in document package. You can choose Templates or Documents.Templates: Templates contain the wizards that can pull information from SalesForce.com as well as prompt for additional information.&amp;nbsp; The information collected from the template will eventually be included in your business documents. Your administrator will create the templates, and you will select as many templates that are needed to construct your final document. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Documents: The documents tab located within the Document Builder displays a list of documents you may want to include in the final composite documents you create. For example, as you build a proposal, you may want to include a white paper or product data sheet. You can select the white paper from the documents tab, and then when you build your document package, the white paper will be added.Selected Documents: This section shows which documents and templates will comprise the document package. Here you can select a template to preview content transferred from SalesForce.com, or you can complete the wizard via the Template Form zone. You can also reorder the items in the list using drag and drop to change the sequence in how documents will appear in the final composite document.Template Form: This section displays fields that have been pulled from SalesForce.com and/or those that require your input.&amp;nbsp; Some of the fields displayed will be read_only while others may be editable depending on how your templates were defined.This document will guide you through the steps of creating your own set of document packages. Before you begin,check with your SpringCM administrator to ensure your account is setup for Document Builder.&amp;nbsp;How is it used?Document&amp;nbsp;Package Builder requires the SpringCM SalesForce.com Integration.

        <title>Document Comparison</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/document_comparison</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?What is it?The SpringCM Document Comparison feature allows the user to easily compare two versions of a Microsoft Word or Excel document and identify the differences between those two document versions.&amp;nbsp; The comparison will create a new document &amp;nbsp;or version with all the differences between the two versions highlighted and track changes enabled, allowing a user to quickly accept or reject the changes to the new document. You can also select two distinct Word or Excel documents and initiate a comparison action as well.&amp;nbsp;This feature is available only as an add_on option and is not included in any SpringCM edition by default. If you do not see this feature enabled in your account, please contact your SpringCM account executive.When is it used?Use this feature whenever you desire to compare versions of a document to identify what changes have been made. It is particularly helpful when you are collaborating on a document with another party to review and sign_off on a document. For example, if you are working with another company or department to finalize a legal document or sales contract, use the Document Comparison feature to see how the latest draft of a document differs from the version you last touched.&amp;nbsp;This feature will increase productivity by eliminating manual steps and shortening the revision cycle.&amp;nbsp; It will also reduce the risk of oversight as a result of manual comparisons.How is it used?Select a document from any document list for which you want to compare two versions.Select File _ Compare&amp;nbsp;from the menu barChoose the two versions of the document that a comparison should be made against.&amp;nbsp; The two most recent versions are selected by default, but any two versions can be compared.Choose which version of the file should be considered the newest version.&amp;nbsp; By default, the higher version is considered the latest version, but the order can be switched if desired.This is important because it will determine how the change will be reported in the comparison document. For example, if you made added a line between the older and current (highest) version of a document, when tracking changes, document comparison will show the new line as an added line. If you reversed the order of the compared documents, in the example above, document comparison will show the line as a line deleted between the two versions.&amp;nbsp;Choose whether the new document should be saved as a higher version of the current document or as a new document with a different name.If you choose to save the document as a new version, a file will be generated showing all the tracked changes between the two files as a brand new version of the selected document.If you choose to save the document with a different name, a default name will be generated showing the two versions of the document used for comparison.&amp;nbsp; You can change this name if desired.Choose the comparison options under Settings.&amp;nbsp; The following options are available:Compare formatting  compares changes in fonts, style, size and other formatting propertiesCompare headers/footers  compares changes in headers and footers of a documentCompare comments  compares changes in comments that were created.&amp;nbsp;Show moves  shows changes to the document itselfBy default, only the Show Moves option is enabled.&amp;nbsp;Click the Compare button to initiate the process to compare documentExpected Results: You will be notified about the success or failure of the comparison when the comparison has been completed. Following a successful completion, you can open the newly created version or document (as determined by the option you selected in step 5 above), and use track changes feature to accept or reject each highlighted change.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Document Annotation Using Pinpoints</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/document_annotation_using_pinpoints</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?To annotate a document with a pinpointTo view an annotationTo print annotationsPinpoints and versioningWhat is it?The Document Annotation feature, also known as pinpoints, enables users to add comments to documents without changing the content of the document itself. The comments can be created and viewed when the document is shown in Document Preview. Multiple users can add comments to the document, enabling collaboration around the content.When is it used?The Document Annotation feature, or pinpoints, are only supported when viewing the document with a view mode of View Preview. Use it whenever you want to make a comment on a document that others will be able to see, but which leaves the document contents unchanged.How is it used?To annotate a document with a pinpointSelect GOTO then Documents from the menu barNavigate to the folder containing the document you want to annotate.Click on the document you want to annotate to go into Document Preview.If your view mode does not default to View Preview, select View then View Preview from the menu bar.Select Pinpoint then choose a color for your pinpoint from the drop down menu.Click at the place in the document where you want to add your annotation. This will open up a dialog for entering your comment.Enter your commentClick Save to save your comment. This will cause the dialog to collapse, leaving only a pinpoint in the selected color.Repeat for each annotation that you want to add to the document. You can add as many as you like with a variety of pinpoint colors.To view an annotationWhen in Document Preview with view mode set to View Preview, you may see one or more pinpoints in the document.To view the comment, simply click on each pinpoint. It will expand to show the comment and will show you who made the comment and when it was made. Click again on the pinpoint to collapse it.If you are reviewing many pinpoints, it is easiest to use pinpoint navigation, as described below:Select Pinpoint then Show Pinpoint Navigation from the menu bar. This will open up the left hand navigation panel and show a list of all comments.Use the scroll bar on the left hand navigation panel to scroll through the list of comments.Click on the comment to be taken to the place in the document where the comment was made and see the comment in context.Alternatively, you can select Pinpoint, then either Next Pinpoint or Preview Pinpoint from the menu bar to navigate through the comments.When you are finished you can turn off the pinpoint navigation by selecting Pinpoint then Show Pinpoint Navigation from the menu bar a second time.To print annotationsAnnotations are comments that exist outside of the document. To print the document along with the comments you will use the Download with Comments feature.Click on the document to view it in Document Preview.If you see pinpoints, then you can print the pinpoint comments by first selecting File then Download with Comments from the menu bar.This will convert the document and the comments to PDF format, and prompt you to download the document.Open the downloaded PDF document.Print the downloaded PDF document.Expected Results: The PDF document will contain a rendering of all of the pages of the document. Wherever a pinpoint was placed in the document, there will be a number indicating the comment number. On the last page of the printout, there will be a numbered comment listing which will display the comment for each numbered placeholder.Pinpoints and VersioningPinpoints are specific to a version of the document. That is, they apply only to the version on which the pinpoint annotations were made. As new versions are created, the pinpoints made on the previous version will not be carried over to the new version. If you want to see annotations made on a prior version, review the document history and select the prior version.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

These options appear in the left portion of the window.The default layout shows all tabs. If all tabs are hidden, the six icons located directly above the menus represent the Dashboard, Documents, Address Book, Workflows, Reports, and Preferences tabs. To see which workspace an icon represents, hover your cursor over an icon. The option name will appear below or to the side of the icon as the example to the left demonstrates.Customizing Your DesktopThe drop_down menu located to the direct right of the Preferences icon contains three choices for the tabs: More Options, Fewer Options, and All Options. These settings allow for further customization of your Navigation panel.For example, if youve hidden all options, clicking More Options three times sequentially reveals the Dashboard, Documents, and Address Book tabs. If you want to temporarily hide several tabs to better see the links menus in the Navigation panel, you can drag the bar located between the tabs and the links menus.If you desire more workspace, you can collapse the Navigation panel into a slim vertical panel. You can easily return to the default Navigation panel when youve finished reading a document and need more space for your tabs. To collapse the Navigation panel, click the &amp;lt;&amp;lt; located icon in the upper_left corner directly below the trademark graphic.NOTE: The icon will change to &amp;gt;&amp;gt; once the Navigation panel is collapsed. To return to the default Navigation panel, click the &amp;gt;&amp;gt; icon.ListsLists are intuitively organized to assist you with browsing through and easily modifying your content. The upper_right corner of a list contains controls that enable you to choose how many results to display and to jump between pages. You can double_click any row to edit its content.Links MenusThe Links menus provide instant access to the most frequently used functions of the workspace you are currently viewing. Links vary depending upon which workspace you have selected.Document SearchThe Search tool, located in upper_right corner of all workspaces, performs quick and thorough text searches of your entire document library. It also looks for keywords that you can add to documents attributes at any time.Advanced Search queries enable you to search for phrases that include or exclude certain words or by date using the modified Between Dates options boxes. Detailed Search queries also include the ability to search for any of the following: Modified between, Keywords, Folders, File Types, Title Text, Body Text, Received From, With_in, and Attributes. Click the Advanced Search button to access these options.System ActionsThe System Actions drop_down menu appears in the upper_right Menu Options only after you have initiated a multi_step process such as sending a document, creating a workflow, or setting access permissions.

        <title>Default Document Attributes</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/default_document_attributes</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Advanced ConceptsWhat is it?Default Document Attributes can be applied to SpringCM folders so that as documents are uploaded to that folder, an attribute value will be automatically applied to the document, eliminating the need for users to manually enter a value.By using Default Document Attributes, you can minimize the human steps necessary to categorize and subsequently index documents by automatically assigning these values based on the folder that the document is added to.&amp;nbsp;Further, by applying attributes in this manner, attributes will up applied upon upload and these attributes can, in turn, but used to kickoff other automated events (like initiating a workflow or sending email notifications to a set of users, etc.).If there are existing documents in the folder when you apply the&amp;nbsp; Default Document Attributes, the attribute values will be applied to all documents within the folder, as well as propagated through sub_folders and documents in sub_folders.&amp;nbsp;When is it used?Default document attributes are used to assign attribute values that will always have the same value on all documents within the folder they reside, including all sub_folders and documents in sub_folders.&amp;nbsp;For example, if you have client or project folders, all documents and sub_folders might have the same attribute value which denotes the client or project (e.g., Client Name:&amp;nbsp; XYZ, Client ID: 789).&amp;nbsp; This feature ensures attributes applied to the top_level folder are automatically applied to all sub_folders and documents below the top_level folder.Do not use this method of applying defaults if the documents with in the folder will require unique attribute values. If you desire to do a bulk update of document attributes which provides the ability to assign unique attribute values, see the knowledge article titled Bulk Attribute Assignment.Repeatable fields cannot be assigned default values using this method.How is it used?Navigate to the folder you wish to set default document attributes for OR select a single folder by using the checkbox next to the folder name (when you are browsing the Documents workspace).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the menu bar, click Manage and then Attributes.The folder selected will be displayed by doing the following:Click +Group and choose the Attribute Group.&amp;nbsp;Once this has been selected, click +Field to add each field you wish to use. If a field is greyed out, it means that it is not a valid field for selection.After the field has been added, provide a default value. The default value must be a valid value for the field which will pass both content and format validation.Note: If you select a field to display, but leave the field blank, it will clear values from all documents.Once you have&amp;nbsp;selected the group and fields/field values, you will click Save.&amp;nbsp;There&amp;nbsp;will be a confirmation box&amp;nbsp;that appears to confirm you wish to take the action (once you click save, the&amp;nbsp;updates will&amp;nbsp;carry down to all sub_folders and all documents&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;all sub_folders) _ click OK if you accept this warning.Advanced ConceptsOnly Super and User Administrators&amp;nbsp;will be able to&amp;nbsp;modify these settings.Any document that&amp;nbsp;enters OR is moved into the folder or any of its sub_folders, will automatically have the default&amp;nbsp;document attributes applied to it, replacing any previous attribute value that may have been applied to the document.If a User Administrator makes a change to default attributes, the changes will only apply to the folders and documents that user has &quot;Set Access&quot; permissions to.&amp;nbsp; Any sub_folders or documents in the folder or sub_folders without full &quot;Set Access&quot; will NOT be updated.If a field is selected and left blank, once &quot;Save&quot; is clicked, it has the affect of clearing all values from that field from all documents in the folder and any sub_folders.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Cascading Attributes</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/cascading_attributes</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Step 1: Create a source fileStep 2: Create a cascading attribute set in an attribute groupWhat is it?Cascading attributes are drop down attribute fields within an attribute group where the valid values presented in the drop down are determined based on an input file and by the value selected in a previously entered parent attribute field. A classic example of the use of Cascading Attributes is the relationship one would see when entering Country, State and City. The valid State values would be determined by the entry for Country, and the valid City values would be determined by the entry for State.&amp;nbsp; It is possible to have many layers of cascading attributes within an attribute group, and a set of cascading attributes can be made repeatable so that you can enter more than one set for a single document.This knowledge article assumes that you are already familiar with attribute groups. If you are are not familiar with attribute groups refer first to our knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups. Only SpringCM Super Administrators can setup Cascading Attributes.When is it used?Use Cascading attributes in an attribute group any time you want to filter attribute values based on the value of a previously entered related attribute value. Using Cascading Attributes will ensure that the attributes you apply to documents are valid, and it will facilitate searching for documents by making sure that values are valid and conform to the defined data relationships.For example, assume there is a set of cascading attributes in the attribute group Cars for recording the Make, Model, and Color. Selecting Ford in the Make attribute field, will limit the values for Model to ensure that the user does not input a model for a different Make. Likewise, if Color is limited by the Make and Model of a car, then the user cannot input a color that is not valid for that Make and Model.By ensuring that only valid values can be entered, document search results will be much more accurate and it makes data entry of attributes much easier for the end user.How is it used?The use Cascading Attributes you must begin by defining your data values and the relationship between those data values. The valid value are stored in comma_separated values&amp;nbsp; (*.csv) or text (*.txt) file. This file is referred to as the Source File.The first line of the Source File must contain the field names, one in each column. The field or column names must match the names of the attribute fields in your attribute group. The fields or columns should be ordered starting with the highest level parent field in the left_most column, with the children appearing as columns moving right. Each row will represent a valid combination of each of the fields. For example, using our Cars example from above a logical representation of the file would be:The Source File will be stored in SpringCM as a .csv or .txt file, in a general location that all users will have read access to.&amp;nbsp; When the file is opened or created with a text editor, it should look like rows of comma_separated values as shown below:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Make, Model, Color&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ford, Focus, Red&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Kia, Spectra, Blue&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ford, Focus, Green&amp;nbsp;The latest version of the Source File will always be the one used to obtain the valid values, so as values the need for more values arises, you may edit the document in SpringCM creating a new version with the new values. If you find that you need to add a new field (i.e., Model Year), this can be done by editing the Source File in SpringCM as well. However, if you do this, you will need to make the associated changes to the attribute group as well. Adding a field after initial implementation can present some challenges for existing documents, so it is considered best practice to think through your needs upfront when initially defining the Cascading Attribute Set.Step 1: Create a source fileType your valid data values into a text editor or a CSV editor in the format discussed above making sure the field names are in the first row and the order of the field names represents the parent_child relationship. Then save this file to your local hard drive.Identify or create an easily referenced, general use folder within your SpringCM account to which all uses will have read access and where the Source File will be stored.Upload the Source File from the local hard disk to this folder, providing a descriptive name for the file.Note that path of the source file name where the file is stored in SpringCM (e.g., /Account/foldername/foldername.../sourcefilename.csv). You will need this in the next step.Step 2: Create a cascading attribute set in an attribute groupBegin by creating your attribute group as instructed in the knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups.When you are ready to define your cascading attribute set, Click the&amp;nbsp; +Cascading Set button.Enter a Name for the cascading set. This name will appear in the navigation panel within Document Preview as a section that can be collapsed and expanded.Enter the SpringCM path to your source file which you recorded in step 1.Click Show Source File Fields. This will validate that the Source File can be accessed and display the field names and field order for reference.&amp;nbsp; If it does not validate, check your entry of the path.Enter one attribute field in the cascading set for each field name listed. The attribute field name must match the field name from the Source File, and the attribute fields must be in the same order as the fields in the Source File._ Click +FIELD if you need to add additional fields to accomplish this task._ For each field that you add, select Cascade as the field type._ For each field that you add, set the appropriate attribute field control options.See the the knowledge article titled Creating and Managing Attribute Groups if you require assistance defining the attribute fields within the cascading attribute set.If you would like the end users to be able to enter more than one set of cascading attributes, check the Repeatable option for the set (as opposed to the individual attribute fields within the set).Select Save to save the attribute group.Test the attribute group by applying it to a document in document preview, and make sure that the values are filtering properly based on the data in the source file, and the parent_child relationship.</content:encoded>

        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it used?How is it used?Advanced ConceptsWhat is it?The authorization process is a one time setup that grants access to the application to allow it access to SpringCM on your behalf. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When is it used?It is used when you need to install and setup access for one of the SpringCM local applications, including SpringCM Scan, SpringCM Business Sync, SpringCM Mobile, and SpringCM Edit.How is it used?To complete the authorization process, the user will perform the following steps using the following dialog as reference.Upon launch of the application, the user will receive an authorization dialog similar to the one shown above.Select the Authorization TypeStandard Authorization _ used when you access SpringCM from the SpringCM login Page.SSO Authorization _ Single Sign_On (SSO) Authorization is used when you access SpringCM from an identify provider configured by your Account Administrator. In this case, the user is accessing a centralized authentication server that all other applications and systems use.If SSO Authorization is selected, enter your SpringCM Account Id in the field provided. This account id will have been provided by the SpringCM administrator.Enter or change the Device Name. The Device Name allows the Account Administrator to more easily recgonize which devices are registered and accessing SpringCM by a specified user. It will default to your computer name.Select AuthorizeIf the user had previously selected Standard Authorization, then the user will be prompted to enter their email address and password and complete the login process to SpringCM.Enter or change the Device Name. The Device Name allows the Account Administrator to more easily recgonize which devices are registered and accessing SpringCM by a specified user.&amp;nbsp;Select AuthorizeIf the user had previously selected Standard Authorization, then the user will be prompted to enter their email address and password and complete the login process to SpringCM.If the user had previously selected SSO Authorization, then the user will be prompted to enter their corporate user name and password and complete the login process to their corporate authentication system.When the user has completed the login process, the user will then need to select Approve to complete the Authorization process for the application.The email address will be passed back to the application and setup for use.Advanced ConceptsSSO Considerations _ The following are requirements for using the Single Sign_on as the authorization method. If these conditions are not met, then when the user selects Authorize, they will be prompted to login to SpringCM as if Standard Authorization was selected.The Account must be configured in SpringCM for SSO.The Account ID must be provided to the users as they setup their application.The user's default account must be setup for SSO.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

Folder: Output directoryFolder: x86_Release_SpringCMFolder: FilesMSI Installer: SpringCM_Edit.msiDeployment Files: SpringCMEditConfiguration Templates: DefaultConfigapplication settings: options.xmlproxy settings: proxysettings.xmlEdit.Core.dllNewtonsoft.Json.dllNLog.configNLog.dllRestSharp.dllSpringCM.Application.Common.dllSpringCMEdit.exeSpringConnector.dllSystem.Data.SQLLite.dll&amp;nbsp;Setup Bootstrapper: setup.exe___ This is not part of the installer but can be used on certain situations under conditions where an .exe package can be pushed to clients.&amp;nbsp;The MSI uses &quot;Uncompressed&quot; mode which allows the IT Administrator to change specific files which are part of the installation package. &amp;nbsp;See &quot;Overriding settings&quot; below. This means that the application files are not packed inthe MSI but instead are placed alongside the MSI installer.&amp;nbsp;The MSI installer can be pushed to client workstations typically by configuring a Group Policy object on the domain controller.&amp;nbsp;When SpringCM Edit is installed via the scriptable installer, the end user will need to do the following after the installation:Reboot the computerAccept the license agreementAuthorize the app to begin using it.&amp;nbsp;What are the prerequisites? .NET 4.0 Full (9.0.30729) x86 or x64The .NET Framework 4.0 installer can be obtained from the Microsoft website or pushed to the client workstation using WSUS or some other mechanism.Web Installer:&amp;nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en_us/download/details.aspx?id=17851Stand alone Installer:&amp;nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en_us/download/details.aspx?id=17718If the user installs Edit manually, these items are installed as part of the package.&amp;nbsp;If Edit has been installed manually prior to the push installation, it should be completely uninstalled prior to completing a fresh installation of Edit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How to deploy? The Push deployment is typically set up using Group Policy on the windows domain controller. This overview does not walk through configuring the MSI installer as each organization has different standards and requirements. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The MSI installer is a standard MSI package which means that it accepts standard msiexec parameters. It uses the silent switch by default when deployed using Group Policy. &amp;nbsp;Please refer to the following Knowledge Base Article:&amp;nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816102. When placing the MSI file on the server, the application files &amp;nbsp;found in the SpringCM folder need to be placed in a shared folder parallel to the MSI.&amp;nbsp;Each managed versions should have its own root folder. This ensures that the application can be uninstalled or upgraded properly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What are the override settings? Overridable settings can be found in x86_Release_SpringCM\Files\SpringCM\Edit\DefaultConfig folder &amp;nbsp;in the decompressed scriptable installer package. The user is able to change most settings after the application has been installed with the exception of Check for Updates. These settings templates are meant to minimize the number of steps that the user needs to perform after the installation is complete.Proxysettings.xml&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf_8&quot;?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ProxySettings xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema_instance&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://springcm.net/schemas/syncclient/proxyconfig/v1&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Mode&amp;gt;Auto&amp;lt;/Mode&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Url&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Url&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;Port&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Port&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;RequiresAuthentication&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/RequiresAuthentication&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;UserName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/UserName&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ProxySettings&amp;gt;XML ModeDescriptionModeNo Proxy: Used if you do not access a proxy server to access resources on the internet. Choose this option if you do not use a proxy server. If you have a proxy server configured in Windows and this option is selected, then the Windows proxy configured will not be utilized.Auto_detect: Used if a proxy server is configured in Windows. Selecting Auto_detect is used when the Proxy is setup in LAN Settings in WindowsManual:&amp;nbsp; Used typically by advanced users when a non_standard proxy server configuration has been implemented. SpringCM Sync only supports HTTP Proxy servers. SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 Proxy server implementations are not supported.UrlThis contains the URL or IP address of the proxy server. For example: 192.168.110.5PortThe port that the proxy server is setup to listen at. For example: 8080Requires AuthenticationWhether or not the proxy server requires usernames and password from the user. For example: true, falseUserNameThe username can be setup in the templates but this is not reqiored as the user is required to enter their username and password the first time the application is executed when Requires Authentication is set to true.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Options.xml&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;Windows_1252&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;CloudEditSettings xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema_instance&quot; xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://springcm.net/schemas/cloudedit/config/v1&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;AutomaticUpdates&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/AutomaticUpdates&amp;gt; &amp;lt;IsDiagnosticLoggingEnabled&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/IsDiagnosticLoggingEnabled&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Email&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/Email&amp;gt; &amp;lt;AccountID&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/AccountID&amp;gt; &amp;lt;UseSSO&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/UseSSO&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/CloudEditSettings&amp;gt;AutomaticUpdatesThis is used to identify if Edit checks for new versions automatically. When the application is beinf pushed to remove clients, this should be disabledIsDiagnosticLoggingEnabledBy default this is set to false. It should only be set to true if an issue has occurred that requires analysis by SpringCMEmailShould not be set.UseSSOThis is used to identify if the user accesses a Single Sign On Identity Provider or if they access SpringCM via the SpringCM login page. For example: true, falseAccountIDThe AccountID is&amp;nbsp;only set when the customer is using SSO. The user can enter this value but it would be for the Admin to set this value.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What are the rules?Typically the configuration templates are used as a means of first configuration. They cannot be used to enforce specific configuration on an end machine.The configuration templates are installed by the MSI installer under %APPDATA%\SpringCM\SpringCM Edit\DefaultConfig\The following rules apply:First start after installApplication picks up the default settings and makes these per_user settings (per user settings are located under %APPDATA%\SpringCM\SpringCM Edit\UpgradeThe DefaultConfig will be updated from the distribution server, but application will not pick the new settings (it will continue using the existing per_user settings)Re_configurationThe user can come back to the setting template by manually deleting per_user settings while sync is not running and restarting sync.The Administrator should disable checking for automatic updates and should push updates to SpringCM Edit&amp;nbsp;based on defining the GPO Policy. &amp;nbsp;You can disable checking for auomatic updates by setting&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;AutomaticUpdates&amp;gt;Disabled&amp;lt;/AutomaticUpdates&amp;gt;</content:encoded>

        <title>Configuring Get It! in Salesforce</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/configuring_get_it_in_salesforce</link>
        <description>&amp;nbsp;</description>
        <content:encoded>&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;How is it configured?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What is it?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Get it! app searches for, and dynamically delivers, content specific to the profile information on a Salesforce page.The SpringCM Get it! App searches for and dynamically delivers content specific to the Salesforce object.&amp;nbsp;Get it! can deliver content specific to the current stage of your Opportunity or the company you are competing against in a deal. As an opportunity advances from one stage to the next, the Get it! app can delivers the appropriate content for that stage. &amp;nbsp;When is it used?&amp;nbsp;The SpringCM Get It! App&amp;nbsp;is used in cases where the organization wants to provide the right context helping the end user achieve the objective. Typical examples include the followingdisplaying&amp;nbsp;content from a particular folder in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;presenting a kill sheet based on the competitor in a given&amp;nbsp;opportunity.providing stage based content. This information can help the Sales Rep present the correct material to the customer or can help lead the Sales Rep down the right path to help close the deal.&amp;nbsp;showing specific content like manuals and sales sheets based on the&amp;nbsp;product selected.How is it configured?&amp;nbsp;As an Administrator, you will perform the following tasks:Setup Get it!:&amp;nbsp;Here you will be defining the SpringCM Search that runs everytime the app&amp;nbsp;runs.&amp;nbsp;Create the Visualforce Page that represents each App. You may have multiple Get It! Apps configured and each one needs its own Visualforce Page.&amp;nbsp;Update the Page Layout: Here you will show the app&amp;nbsp;on the object.When you define a new Get It App,&amp;nbsp;Please navigate to&amp;nbsp;All Tabs.&amp;nbsp;Select&amp;nbsp;SpringCM Setup from&amp;nbsp;All Tabs.Select Configure Get It! AppsSelect Add New Get It! App. &amp;nbsp;You can create multiple Get It! Apps for each object.&amp;nbsp;The next set of steps defines how a Get It! App&amp;nbsp;is defined.Select the Salesforce object where Get It! will be displayed.&amp;nbsp;Define the SpringCM Search:This search will be executed every time Get It! loads. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There are a number of parameters that you can set up in the search. These include the following:&amp;nbsp;All Words _ This creates an AND relationship between the words. For example, entering software contract will find only documents containing both the words software AND contract.Any Words&amp;nbsp;_ This creates an OR relationship between the words. For example, entering software contract will find any documents with either the word software OR contract, including documents that contain both.Phrase _ This will treat the words entered as a phrase. It is equivalent to entering a quoted string. For example, entering software contract will find only documents which have the phrase &quot;software contract&quot; in it.Without Words _ Specifying a word in this field will eliminate any document from the search results that contains the specified word. If more than one word is specified, any document containing either of the two words will be eliminated, such that it is interpreted as &quot;this or that word.&quot;If you enter text into more than one of these fields, please note that all criteria must be met in order for the document to be returned in the search hit list. For example, if you're searching for either proposals OR&amp;nbsp;quotes for the company WorldClass Enterprises, enter World Class Enterprises in the With this Phrase field AND&amp;nbsp;proposal quote in the With any of these Words field. This will be interpreted as &quot;search for all documents containing the phrase WorldClass Enterprises and having either the word proposal or quote in it.&quot;See the knowledge article titled Search Tips for additional information and examples on how to enter search criteria.Document Name: &amp;nbsp;Search for text in the title of the document.Updated By (email):&amp;nbsp;Enter a person's SpringCM User Login ID to search for documents that were last modified by that user.Content: &amp;nbsp;Search for text in the body of the document.Description: &amp;nbsp;Search for text in the descriptio of the field.Updated on or Before: Search for documents with a Modified date field on or before the specified date. Use the date format YYYY_MM_DD.Updated on or After: &amp;nbsp;Search for documents with a Modified date field on or after&amp;nbsp;the specified date. Use the date format YYYY_MM_DD.In Folder:&amp;nbsp;Search for documents in a single folder. This field can be can used by itself return all the documents in a given folder. Note: This field cannot be used in conjunction with the Salesforce Object Type and Object Id.&amp;nbsp;Include Sub Folders: &amp;nbsp;Used in&amp;nbsp;conjunction&amp;nbsp;with the In Folder field. Search for documents within all the folders underneath the folder in the In Folder field.Salesforce Object Type: This is used in conjunction with the Salesfore Object Id and allows you to search within the folder that represents the object.&amp;nbsp;Salesforce Object Id:&amp;nbsp;This is used in conjunction with the Salesfore Object Type&amp;nbsp;and allows you to search within the folder that represents the object. &amp;nbsp;By default, a search is conducted against the most recent version of all documents in the account to which the current user has access. This is referred to as the search scope. The search scope determines the pool of content or objects that will be searched for the specified criteria.You can also incorporate Spring CM Attributes&amp;nbsp;into your search resultsIn Any Attribute Field: Search for documents with a certain value in any Attribute field.Attribute Field located in the Attributes section. If this is utilized, then the search will look at each document and assess all attribute fields (regardless of group) for the particular value. If not set, it will not be used.&amp;nbsp;Group: Search by specific attribute groups. Check Exclude Group to&amp;nbsp;eliminate&amp;nbsp;an attribute group from the search. This could be used in conjunction with In Any Attribute Field and restrict/eliminate a particular Attribute Group.&amp;nbsp; Multiple groups and fields can be added to the search criteria.Add Field: &amp;nbsp;This is displayed after selecting an attribute group. Search for documents with a certain value in a specific attribute field. Multiple Fields can be added.&amp;nbsp;The search will interpret this case as an AND relationship or &quot;documents having this property AND that property.Here are a set of best practices that you should follow if using Salesforce data in your search:Object fields referenced in the search should be required to be entered in Salesforce. If these fields are not required, then your search may not return the desired results.Standard object fields are used anywhere in the search&amp;nbsp;by entering {!FieldName}. &amp;nbsp;You can find a list of standard fields in Salesforce by going to Customize, selecting the Object, and then going to Fields.&amp;nbsp;Custom object fields are referenced by&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;looking at the API Name in Custom Fields. For example, if &amp;nbsp;Competition has been added to an Opportunity, then&amp;nbsp;Competition would be represented by {!Competition__c}.The {!ParentObject.Name} is a lookup or master_detail relationship and must be a field on the child object in order to link it to the parent object. This will not work with a related list like Contacts to Opportunities.&amp;nbsp;With the Get It! App, you can query Salesforce for information about the current object and use that information to execute&amp;nbsp;a search in SpringCM. &amp;nbsp;Once you are done, now save the new Get It! App.&amp;nbsp;Create a Visualforce page for each new Get It! app that is created. &amp;nbsp;Do this by:Navigating to&amp;nbsp;Setup in SalesforceSelecting DevelopSelecting PagesSelecting&amp;nbsp;NewPaste in the following Apex code:&amp;lt;apex:page standardController=&quot;Opportunity&quot; &amp;gt; &amp;lt;SpringCMEos:SpringCM_DSWGrid objectType=&quot;Opportunity&quot; partnerUrl=&quot;{!$Api.Partner_Server_URL_180}&quot; objectId=&quot;{!Id}&quot; searchName=&quot;MarketingInfo&quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/apex:page&amp;gt;You may end up changing any of the following three items when setting up the Visualforce Page.&amp;nbsp;objectId= This is the ID of the object that the GetIt! App&amp;nbsp;is embedded into. Typically, the value {!Id} is not changed as the search should be related to the actual Salesforce object that you are on. It is possible to setup the search to always look at a specific object in Salesforce.objectType= This is set to the type of object that the App will be installed in.&amp;nbsp;searchName= This is the name of the Get It! search defined above.In the example below, the&amp;nbsp;searchName has been updated to match the search created above.&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;apex:page standardController=&quot;Opportunity&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;SpringCMEos:SpringCM_DSWGrid objectType=&quot;Opportunity&quot; partnerUrl=&quot;{!$Api.Partner_Server_URL_180}&quot; objectId=&quot;{!Id}&quot; searchName=&quot;Opportunity by Stage&quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/apex:page&amp;gt;Enter the label and optionally a description.Select Save.Now, that we have created the Visualforce Page, we can add it to the page layout(s) for the Salesforce object.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Do this by:Navigating to&amp;nbsp;Setup&amp;nbsp;in Salesforce.Selecting&amp;nbsp;Customize&amp;nbsp;from the Build Menu.Selecting the Object in question.&amp;nbsp;Selecting Page Layouts.Selecting Edit&amp;nbsp;for the Page Layout you want to update.Navigating to the location on the page where you want the Get it! App.&amp;nbsp;Selecting Visualforce Pages.&amp;nbsp;Drag and drop the GetIt! App Visualforce Page onto the Layout. &amp;nbsp;The best practice here is&amp;nbsp;to do the following:Add the app&amp;nbsp;into its own section.Configure the section as a 1_column layout.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You can update the height of the app by clicking on the wrench. Reccomended heigth's&amp;nbsp;are 200 and 300 pixels. You should not need to change the width.&amp;nbsp;Save the Layout.Now, go to a Salesforce object and validate that the app&amp;nbsp;loads and that it presents documents that meet the search result.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>Document Preview and Navigation Panel</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/document_preview_and_navigation_panel</link>
        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it Used?How is it Used?To browse document pagesTo change view modeTo find or print in Document PreviewTo add a description to or change the name of a documentTo view related documentsTo add Document RemindersTo index a documentButtons in the Navigation PanelAdvanced ConceptsWhat is it?Document Preview is SpringCM's default method for viewing documents. It is automatically launched when you click on a document name. With this feature, you can easily view documents within SpringCM without the need to download the document or install a local application. The document is rendered in GIF format, a universal format with broad browser support.The Document Preview Navigation Panel is a collapsible panel on the left hand side of the Document Preview page which enables you to index and identify your documents by using Attributes, as well as navigate through your document list.When is it Used?Document Preview will be used whenever you want to view one or more documents without the need to download the document. This is particularly helpful in low_bandwidth environments, where downloads can result in slow rendering of content, and where they can affect overall network performance. Additionally, it allows you to view the contents of the document even if you do not have an associated local application installed, so it is perfect for use on public computers where a local application may not be installed.Document Preview and its Navigation Panel will also be used when you want to index your content using Attributes. Indexing your document with Attributes allows for a enhanced searching, classification of content for reporting and dashboards, and triggering of rules and workflows.How is it Used?You will enter Document Preview simply by clicking on a document name in any document list. The document will, by default, be shown in GIF format, also referred to as View Preview mode. Once in preview mode, you can perform a number of different actions on the document or change the view mode to something other than View Preview.To browse document pagesAfter the document has been rendered in Document Preview, you can scroll down or up through the document pages using your mouse or scrollbar like you would while reading any webpage.Additionally, you can select the View option on the menu bar, then select one of the options First Page, Previous Page, Next Page, or Last Page for more targeted navigation.To change view modeWhile View Preview mode provides an easy way to view documents without downloading, it is not the only option. Additional options exist which you may need to use from time to time to enable certain functionality not available in View Preview mode. The available modes are:View Preview _ this is the default view mode. It renders the document in GIF format. The advantages of this format is that it does not require download, it is supported in a wide variety of browsers, and it exposes the SpringCM annotation feature commonly referred to as pinpoints.View PDF _ this view mode renders the document in PDF format and displays the document in an embedded PDF viewer. The advantages of this format is that it does not require download and it exposes additional functionality available in an embedded PDF viewer such as find within document and print.View Native Format _ this view mode downloads the document to the local machine and displays the document in its native application (e.g., Microsoft Excel). Use this mode when the document is not being rendered to your satisfaction in either view Preview or View PDF modes.Change view mode by following these steps:Click on any document to view it in Document Preview. It will default to View Preview mode.Select View from the menu bar.Select the desired view mode from the View drop down menu.If you selected View Native Format, follow the prompts in the pop_up window to open the document and click OK.To find or print in Document PreviewClick on any document to view it in Document Preview. It will default to View Preview mode.Select View then View PDF from the menu bar. This will change the view mode to View PDF.This will launch an embedded PDF viewer.To Find: On the top of the PDF viewer, there will be a Find icon (i.e., magnifying glass). Click on the Find icon or invoke a find using the keyboard (Ctrl+F on Microsoft Windows or Command+F on MAC OS). Enter the string you want to find, and use the navigation bar within the PDF viewer to navigate through the hits.To Print: On the top of the PDF view, there will be a Print icon (i.e., printer). Click on the Print icon or invoke a print using the keyboard (Ctrl+P on Microsoft Windows or Command+P on MAC OS). Use the resulting dialog to select your printer and complete the print operation. The document will print as it was rendered in PDF format, without the need for a local application.To add a description to or change the name of a documentA searchable document name will be set upon upload. You can also add a searchable description to the document which will further describe the contents of the document adding more detail than the document name alone and enhance searching for the document. The description is not set by default upon upload of the document, so you will need to set it afterward. To change the document name or add a description in Document Preview:Click on any document to view it in Document Preview.Expand the left hand navigation panel to expose the name and description fields. If you do not see these fields you may need to expand the section titled Information by clicking on the triangle next to the word Information.Type in the desired document name. For consistency, maintain the same file extension when renaming documents. Using the same file extension is not required, but it avoids confusion because the file extension is used to determine which file type icon will be displayed for the document.Type in the desired description for the documentClick Save.To view related documentsRelationships can be established between documents based on common attributes. See the knowledge article titled Attributes for more information on how to establish a relationship. Once a relationship has been established, the related documents can be see within Document Preview as follows:Click on any document to view it in Document Preview.Expand the left hand navigation panel to expose the Related Documents. If you do not see the Related Documents tag you may need to expand the section titled Information by clicking on the triangle next to the word Information.Click any of the related documents to open them in Preview Mode.To view or create Document RemindersDocument Reminders Feature VideoYou can create up to 10 reminders on a document.&amp;nbsp; Reminders will be displayed in chronological order in the left_side panel of the document preview.&amp;nbsp; Clicking on any reminder will display the full information for that Reminder.&amp;nbsp; You can also create Reminder Templates that can be applied in this same panel.&amp;nbsp;Click on any document to view it in Document Preview.On the left hand navigation panel, click Create a Reminder.&amp;nbsp; If there are already Reminders assigned to the document, click the View Reminders button and then the Add Reminder button.&amp;nbsp;If there are any Reminder Templates created, you can select them from the Apply Template dropdown field.&amp;nbsp;If there are not any Reminder Templates, fill in the Name field.&amp;nbsp;In the Scheduled For fields, enter the date and time for the Reminder.In the Send To field, enter the email addresses or user names of who should receive the ReminderEnter an Email Subject line and Email Message to the fields.&amp;nbsp;Click Save.&amp;nbsp;To Index a documentA document is indexed by applying one or more searchable Attributes which will further describe and classify the document to enhance searching and reporting. Attributes can also be used to trigger smart rules and kick_off and control document workflows. To index a document do the following:Click on any document to view it in Document Preview.Expand the left hand navigation panel.Select Attributes from the menu bar, then select from among the available attribute groups presented on the drop down menu.Note: Attribute groups are defined by your SpringCM Super Administrator. If you do not know which attribute group to use or if you do not see an attribute group that is applicable to your document, please see your administrator for more information or refer to the knowledge article titled Attributes.After selecting the attribute group, one or more attributes will be added to the left hand navigation panel which you exposed in step 2 above.Populate each attribute which was added with the appropriate content which describes the current document.Click Apply then Close OR click Save on the navigation panel.Expected Results: The document will be submitted for indexing. When indexing is complete you will be able to search and report on the information that has been added to the attributes. Any Smart Rules that were triggered by the indexing event will be fired, and any subsequent workflows will be kicked off.Buttons in the Navigation PanelApply (Alt+A) _ Click the Apply button to commit any changes to the document's attributes and submit the document for indexing.Close (Alt+C) _ Click the Close button to return to the Documents workspace. Clicking the Close button will nullify any changes you have made in the Information, Attributes, and Document Reminder sections that were not already saved using Apply or Save.Save (Alt+S) _ The Save button saves modifications made in the Information, Attributes, and Document Reminders sections to the open document.Next (Alt+N) _ The Next button enables you to view the next document in the folder without saving any changes you have made. Use the &quot;Alt&quot; and &quot;N&quot; keys on your keyboard for faster processing.Save &amp;amp; Next (Alt+Z) _ The Save &amp;amp; Next button saves your modifications made in the Information, Attributes, and Document Reminders sections and opens the next document in the folder, which alleviates you of extra steps when reviewing large numbers of documents.Advanced ConceptsChanging the default View Mode _ The default View Mode can be changed at both the account level and also at the user level. The user setting will override the account setting. To change this, select GOTO then Preferences on the menu bar, and look for the setting called Default View Mode for Documents in the General Preferences _ Document Viewing for both the user and account. Only Super Administrators can change the account preferences.Change the default zoom for View Preview Mode _ You can increase or decrease the default zoom when using a default view mode of View Preview. The default zoom can be changed at both the account level and also at the user level. The user setting will override the account setting. To change this, select GOTO then Preferences on the menu bar, and look for the Default Zoom setting in General Preferences _ Document Viewing for both the user and account. Only Super Administrators can change the account preferences.Configuring contents of the Navigation Panel _ If you do not want to show certain aspects of the navigation panel, you can hide it by unchecking options from the &quot;Select What Displays in the Information Section&quot; for Preference _ Account _ General Preferences _ Document Viewing.Thumbnail Views _ Thumbnail previews provide a way to view the contents of a document from within a folder and to invoke Document Preview at a targeted place in the document. See the knowledge article titled Thumbnail or Tile View for more information.Document Availability for Preview _ After a new document or document version is added, SpringCM needs to prepare the document for preview. It is submitted to a queue for processing, and it may take a few minutes for it to be available to preview. During this time if you click on the document to preview it, you will receive a message indicating Preview is not yet available. To view this file, click the &quot;Download Document&quot; button. If you have waited sufficient time and you still cannot preview the document, this may be a limitation based on document size.&amp;nbsp; See the knowledge article titled Upload, Download and Conversion Limits for information on size limitation related to document preview.</content:encoded>

        <description>What is it?</description>
        <content:encoded>What is it?When is it Used?How is it Used?What is it?The Document Reminders feature allows SpringCM users to create reminders on documents which trigger an email requesting action be sent to a group of recipients.&amp;nbsp; Up to 10 document reminders can be set on any document in SpringCM.&amp;nbsp;When a reminder is created, a user sets the day and time a reminder will be triggered, as well as creates the email message (explaining the reminder's purpose and required action) to a recipient (or group of recipients).&amp;nbsp; When the reminder date and time criteria is reached, an email is sent from SpingCM to that list of recipients.&amp;nbsp;Reminder Templates allow administrators to pre_define Reminder criteria (the name, date, time, recipients and email message text).&amp;nbsp; This allows users to more quickly create and assign new reminders.&amp;nbsp; Reminder Templates also have an option where the date and time elements of the reminder are automically calculated, based on a number of days/weeks/months OR based on a specific attribute date value that has been assigned to the document.&amp;nbsp;And the reminder recipient's experience will be simple and powerful _ they will receive an email with a link to the document in SpringCM, along with text / instructions associated with the reminder notice.&amp;nbsp; This will allow the recipient to quickly assess what action is required, and then move to complete that action immediately in SpringCM.When is it Used?Document Reminders are used to drive action around your business processes.&amp;nbsp; When triggered, an email will be sent to a set of recipients _ based on the message content and the document it was applied to, the recipient would take appropriate action.&amp;nbsp; Some common examples of reminders might be assigned to documents include:Create 30/60/90 day reminders for expired contracts to automate renewalsReminders for contractual obligations, milestones, invoicingReminders for outdated marketing collateral, &quot;shelf life&quot;, compliance!Reminders to drive document retention policies (e.g. &quot;destroy &amp;gt; 3 years&quot;)Reminders for business cycle events such as annual reviewsMany, many moreHow is it Used?To create a Document Reminder:Document Reminders Feature VideoClick on any document to view it in Document Preview.On the left hand navigation panel, click Create a Reminder.&amp;nbsp; If there are already Reminders assigned to the document, click the View Reminders button and then the Add Reminder button.&amp;nbsp;If there are any Reminder Templates created, you can select them from the Apply Template dropdown field.&amp;nbsp;If there are not any Reminder Templates, fill in the Name field.&amp;nbsp;In the Scheduled For fields, enter the date and time for the Reminder.In the Send To field, enter the email addresses or user names of who should receive the ReminderEnter an Email Subject line and Email Message to the fields.&amp;nbsp;Click Save.To create a Reminder Template (User or Super Administrators only):Reminder Templates Feature VideoNavigate to Preferences tab.Select Reminder Templates.Create a Template Name.&amp;nbsp; This will be the name referenced in the &quot;Apply Template&quot; dropdown field an end user selects from.Create a Reminder Name.&amp;nbsp; This will be the default value for the reminder.&amp;nbsp;You will make a choice for &quot;Select Reminder Date and Time&quot; .&amp;nbsp; There are 3 options:ManuallyBased on the date this template is applied _ enter a value (&quot;30&quot; / &quot;Days&quot;, &quot;1&quot; &quot;Year&quot;, etc.)Using a date stored in the document's attributes _ enter a value (&quot;30&quot; / &quot;Days&quot;, &quot;1&quot; &quot;Year&quot;, etc.)Enter a recipient email or user name in the Send To field.Enter an Email Subject.Enter the Email Message textClick Save.The new template will appear in the Document Preview when &quot;Create Reminder&quot; or &quot;View Reminders&quot; is selected.&amp;nbsp; Click the &quot;Apply Template&quot; dropdown field to select any templates that have been created.&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>

        <title>How Large Folder Contents Are Handled by SpringCM</title>
        <link>https://knowledge.springcm.com/how_large_folder_contents_are_handled_by_springcm</link>
        <description>To maintain consistent and positive user experiences when working in SpringCM, we have implemented a policy on viewing content in large folders (folders with items greater than 10K items).&amp;nbsp; Please note the parameters and expected behavior below:</description>
        <content:encoded>To maintain consistent and positive user experiences when working in SpringCM, we have implemented a policy on viewing content in large folders (folders with items greater than 10K items).&amp;nbsp; Please note the parameters and expected behavior below:SpringCM Folders with under 10,000 items (includes both documents or subfolders):Users will be able to view content and sort any folder with less than 10,000 items.&amp;nbsp; This includes the browser view (in the Documents workspace) as well as via other access points like SFTP.&amp;nbsp; Users can sort the content by the Name, Description, Modified By or Modified Date columns.SpringCM Folders with over 10,000 items (includes both documents or subfolders):&amp;nbsp;For any folder that exceeds 10,000 items, in the browser, users will be taken to SpringCM Search, with the folder browsed automatically targeted for the search.&amp;nbsp; Users can then use any search criteria to return the results from the folder.&amp;nbsp; Including modification date ranges, document names (titles), document type, and actual words or phrases from the documents (extracted text).&amp;nbsp;If a user attempts to retreive content via SFTP, an error for &quot;unable to display contents&quot; will be presented. The user will need to leverage an internet browser using the search method above to work with the content.Once a folder reaches 10,000 items, it is flagged in our database as essentially a &quot;large folder&quot; and will remain in that status, requiring a user to leverage search on the folder instead.Outlook for Future Large Folder Content LimitsThe current threshhold is 10,000 items, but this will eventually be reduced to a maximium display of 2,000 items within any folder.&amp;nbsp; There is not a date established for this change, but it will be communicated to all customers and SpringCM System Administrators well in advance of deployment.Questions or Help for Large FoldersIf you have any questions about this policy, please contact support@springcm.com and we will be happy to address them. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</content:encoded>
